  <summary date="2017-05-17T13:42:02Z" status="Passed House amended">Reaffirms that combating corruption in the Northern Triangle is an important policy interest for the United States.

Acknowledges that the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) are currently making important contributions to such effort.

Urges the government of Guatemala to continue to cooperate with CICIG and the government of Honduras to continue to cooperate with MACCIH.

Encourages the governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to:

 publicly support efforts to fight corruption, respect the independence of the judicial branch and the Office of the Attorney General, and ensure that such office in each Northern Triangle country receives sufficient domestic budget allocations in a timely manner to carry out core responsibilities.</summary>
