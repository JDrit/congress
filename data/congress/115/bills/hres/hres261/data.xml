  <summary date="2017-04-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses appreciation for the recent efforts by the Japanese government toward a historic apology for Imperial Japan's maltreatment of U.S. prisoners of war (POWs).

Asks the Department of State to work with that government and representatives of U.S. POWs to memorialize the 75th anniversary of the fall of Bataan on the Philippine Islands by crafting a formal agreement establishing a permanent future fund to understand, preserve, and teach the history of the U.S. POW experience with Japan.</summary>
