  <summary date="2017-04-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes: (1) the importance of U.S. assistance to build Lebanon's capacity to provide services and security for Lebanese citizens; (2) the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as the sole institution entrusted with the defense of Lebanon's sovereignty; and (3) that it is in U.S. interests to support negotiations to end the conflict in Syria, which would allow for the eventual return of the millions of Syrian refugees to Syria.

Encourages coordination between the Department of State, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and humanitarian organizations to ensure that refugees from the conflict in Syria are supported so as to mitigate any destabilizing effects on their host countries.

Supports: (1) the establishment of safe zones in Syria and in the surrounding region in which Syrian nationals displaced from their homeland can await firm settlement; (2) strengthening U.S. partnerships with the LAF, particularly through the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); and (3) full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 calling for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon.</summary>
