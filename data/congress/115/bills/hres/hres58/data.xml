  <summary date="2017-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Urges Russian authorities to grant access to archival collections and to declassify and make publicly available all documents related to Raoul Wallenberg.

Urges: (1) the Russian authorities to work with Wallenberg's family, the Swedish government, and Russian and international scholars, researchers, and archivists to resolve outstanding questions surrounding the circumstances of Wallenberg's arrest and death; and (2) the President, Secretary of State, and other high level U.S. government officials to raise the case of Wallenberg to their Russian counterparts and to request direct access to the original and unredacted documentation in the Russian archives.

Emphasizes the need for independent verification of any information provided by Russian officials.

Reaffirms Wallenberg's humanitarian spirit, personal courage, and nonviolent action in the face of enormous odds and commits to the continued pursuit of answers regarding Wallenberg's fate.</summary>
