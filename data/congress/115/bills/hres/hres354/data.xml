  <summary date="2017-06-06T14:21:03Z" status="Passed House amended">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the rights to peacefully assemble and freely express one's views are essential to American democracy; and (2) the United States should take steps to strengthen free press and civil society freedoms in countries such as Turkey.

Calls for: (1) any Turkish security official who directed or participated in efforts by Turkish security forces to suppress peaceful protests outside of the Turkish Ambassador's residence in Washington, DC on May 16, 2017, to be charged and prosecuted under U.S. law; (2) the Secret Service and the Diplomatic Security Service of the Department of State to review such incident and confirm with the Turkish National Police the standards expected by visiting security details; (3) the State Department to request the waiver of immunity of any Turkish security detail official who engaged in assault in the United States prior to such individual's release from custody; and (4) the State Department to review its security procedures to mitigate the likelihood of such an incident in the future.

Declares that U.S. respect for free speech requires U.S. officials to speak out against such incidents.</summary>
