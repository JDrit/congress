  <summary date="2017-05-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Acknowledges that the spirit of magnanimity and innovation with which the Marshall Plan was enacted are as essential to U.S. foreign policy now as they were in 1947.

Calls upon all Americans to rededicate themselves to the ideals that inspired the Marshall Plan: international cooperation, democracy, free enterprise, and respect for all.</summary>
