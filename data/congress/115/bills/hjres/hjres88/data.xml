This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment declaring that: (1) the rights protected by the Constitution are intended to be the rights of natural persons; (2) the words "people," "person," or "citizen" as used in the Constitution do not include corporations, limited liability companies, or other corporate entities established by the laws of any state, the United States, or any foreign state; and&#160;(3)&#160;such corporate entities are subject to such regulation as the people, through their elected state and federal representatives, deem reasonable and are otherwise consistent with the powers of Congress and the states.

Nothing in the amendment shall be construed to limit the rights of freedom of speech, the press, exercise of religion, association, and all such other unalienable rights of the people.</summary>
