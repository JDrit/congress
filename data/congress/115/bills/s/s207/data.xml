This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to set forth factors that may be considered as evidence to determine whether a controlled substance analogue is intended for human consumption. (Under current law, a controlled substance analogue that is intended for human consumption is treated as a schedule I controlled substance. A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that: has a high potential for abuse; has no currently accepted medical value; and is subject to regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act.)</summary>
