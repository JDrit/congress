This bill designates specified National Forest System lands, National Park System lands, and public lands in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming as wilderness and as components or additions to existing components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

 The bill also designates specified federal lands as biological connecting corridors and as special corridor management areas.

The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate segments of specified rivers and creeks in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

 The bill designates specified areas as wildland recovery areas. The Department of Agriculture shall develop a wildland recovery plan for each recovery area.

 A specified panel of independent scientists shall study roadless lands greater than 1,000 acres that are within the National Forest System in the Wild Rockies bioregion in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, or Wyoming, but not designated as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, for their role in maintaining biological diversity in the Northern Rockies and as part of the overall forest reserve system. Any new or existing road construction or reconstruction or timber harvest is prohibited in those lands after the evaluation. Oil or gas leasing, mining, or other development that impairs the natural and roadless qualities of the land is also prohibited.

 The Department of the Interior may apply the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act in carrying out this bill.</summary>
