  <summary date="2017-01-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act of 2017

This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promulgate regulations within 185 days permitting individuals to import a prescription drug purchased from an approved Canadian pharmacy that:

 is dispensed by a pharmacist licensed in Canada; is purchased for personal use in quantities not greater than a 90-day supply; is filled using a valid prescription issued by a physician licensed to practice in the United States; and has the same active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, and strength as a prescription drug approved under the FFDCA. Certain medications may not be imported, including controlled substances and biological products.

 The bill establishes a certification process for approving Canadian pharmacies. HHS must publish a list of approved Canadian pharmacies.</summary>
