This bill amends the Federal Credit Union Act to&#160;allow a credit union to extend a&#160;member business loan&#160;with respect to&#160;a one- to four-family dwelling, regardless of whether the dwelling is the member's primary residence. Under current law, a member business loan&#160;may be extended&#160;with respect to&#160;such a dwelling only if it is the member's primary residence.</summary>
