  <summary date="2017-04-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill prohibits uniformed service agencies or the Department of Defense (DOD) from altering the amount of the locality-based travel and transportation per diem allowances or reimbursements to which certain uniformed service members or civilian DOD employees are entitled based on the duration of temporary duty assignments or official travel in a locality.

 The bill nullifies the DOD policy implemented on November 1, 2014, regarding reductions in per diem allowances based on the duration of temporary duty assignments or civilian travel.

 The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 is amended to repeal the modifications to the flat rate per diem requirements for DOD military and civilian personnel on long-term temporary duty assignments.</summary>
