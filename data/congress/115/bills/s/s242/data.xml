This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide each veteran who submits a claim for VA benefits with an opportunity to permit a covered congressional employee in the office of the veteran's Member of Congress to have read-only access to all of the veteran's records in the Veterans Benefits Administration databases. A Member may designate up to two such covered congressional employees.

A covered congressional employee may not be recognized as an agent or attorney with respect to veterans' benefit claims.

Funds under this bill may not be used to design or administer any training for covered congressional employees.

The bill makes funds available for FY2018 through FY2021 for such congressional employee access program.</summary>
