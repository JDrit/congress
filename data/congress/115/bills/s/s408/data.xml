  <summary date="2017-02-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Presidential Trade Transparency Act of 2017

This bill requires the President to submit to Congress a report containing a full and complete statement of the President's income earned, assets held, and liabilities owed in the preceding 12 months that are associated with a foreign country:

 with which the United States is negotiating a trade or investment agreement, that is subject to a presidential trade enforcement action determination modifying the tariff treatment of imported articles from such country, or that is designated as eligible for preferential trade treatment under a trade preference program. If the President fails to report such information to Congress:

 any instrument providing for the modification of such tariff treatment shall have no force or effect, and the bill implementing such a trade or investment agreement shall not be eligible for trade authorities (fast track) procedures under the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015.</summary>
