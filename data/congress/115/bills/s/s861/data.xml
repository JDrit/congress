This bill requires federal employees furloughed or required to work during a lapse in appropriations beginning on or after April 28, 2017, to be compensated for the period of the lapse on the earliest date possible after the lapse ends. Employees required to work during the lapse in appropriations may use leave. The bill addresses a lapse in appropriations scheduled to occur if FY2017 appropriations legislation is not enacted prior to the expiration of the continuing resolution that currently funds most federal agencies through April 28, 2017.</summary>
