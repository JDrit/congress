This bill amends the federal criminal code to limit the detention authority of the United States.

Current law prohibits the indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen by the United States unless it is authorized by an act of Congress. This bill prohibits the indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident by the United States unless it is consistent with the Constitution and expressly authorized by an act of Congress.

Additionally, it specifies that a general authorization to use military force or similar measure, on its own, does not authorize the indefinite detention of a citizen or lawful permanent resident who is arrested in the United States.</summary>
