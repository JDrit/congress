  <summary date="2017-01-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill establishes the Commission to End Russian Interference in United States Elections as an independent commission to examine Russian cyber operations and attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. national election. The commission must examine attempts by the Russian government, governments or other entities associated with or collaborating with Russia, or persons or entities in Russia to:

 access, alter, or tamper with voting systems, voter roll information, the Donald J. Trump and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign organizations, and the Democratic and the Republican national committees, congressional campaign committees, and governors associations; promote propaganda relevant to any election for public office held in the United States during 2016; and use electronic means to influence, interfere with, or sow distrust in such elections. The commission must: (1) report on evidence developed by federal agencies; (2) build upon investigations of executive branch, congressional, or independent entities; and (3) make a full accounting of interference attempts and the U.S. response, and government preparedness, to defend against such interference.

The commission may receive classified information and issue subpoenas.

The commission must report to the President and Congress with conclusions and recommendations on preventing a reoccurrence of such interference.</summary>
