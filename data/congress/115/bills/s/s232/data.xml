  <summary date="2017-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the EB-5 visa category.

 The number of fiscal year immigrant visas available for the following employment categories is increased: (1) priority workers; (2) members of the professions with advanced degrees or persons of exceptional ability; (3) skilled workers, professionals, and certain unskilled workers; and (4) certain special immigrants.

The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 is amended to terminate the EB-5 regional center pilot program.

The EB-5 visa provides lawful permanent residence to foreign nationals who invest (directly or through a regional center) a specified amount of capital in a new commercial enterprise in the United States and create at least 10 jobs.</summary>
