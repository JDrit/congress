This bill amends the John F. Kennedy Center Act to reauthorize appropriations for FY2018-FY2021 for maintenance, repair, and security, and capital projects for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

The bill directs that a plaque be placed within the Kennedy Center that contains an inscription to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the National Cultural Center Act by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Kennedy Center must solicit private contributions for the design, procurement, and installation of the plaque.

The Kennedy Center may create displays and programs that memorialize its opening in 1971 and its programmatic legacy.</summary>
