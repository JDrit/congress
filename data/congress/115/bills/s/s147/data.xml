  <summary date="2017-01-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Obamacare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act 

This bill repeals the provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a program of risk corridors for 2014, 2015, and 2016 under which qualified health plans must participate in a payment adjustment system based on the ratio of a plan's allowable costs to its premiums. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are the only plans eligible for premium subsidies, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.)</summary>
