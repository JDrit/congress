This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to issue climate change obligations. The proceeds from the debt obligations must be deposited in the Adapt America Fund established by this bill within the Department of Commerce.

Commerce must carry out an investment program to fund projects for reducing economic, social, and environmental impact of the adverse effects of climate change.

The bill establishes the Climate Change Advisory Commission to: (1) establish recommendations, frameworks, and guidelines for the investment program; and (2) identify categories of the most cost-effective investments and projects that emphasize multiple benefits to commerce, human health, and ecosystems.</summary>
