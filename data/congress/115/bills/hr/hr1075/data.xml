This bill nullifies Executive Order 13769, entitled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States," is null and void, shall have no force and effect, and may not be implemented or enforced. No federal funds may be used to implement or enforce any of the policy changes set forth in such order.

Among the order's major provisions are restrictions on the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants from seven countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and additional limitations on refugee admissions to the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security shall release any alien in custody under authority of such order. Visas or documentation that were revoked or refused under authority of such order shall be reissued or reconsidered as appropriate unless a consular officer knows, or has reason to believe, that the alien is ineligible to receive the visa or documentation under any provision of the immigration laws.

The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to prohibit an alien from being given immigration visa preference, being discriminated against, or being denied U.S. entry or admission based upon religion or lack of religious beliefs.

The President may may not exercise his or her authority to suspend or restrict the U.S. entry of aliens or classes of aliens so as to modify the entry, reentry, or admission requirements of an alien having a valid and unexpired: (1) immigrant or nonimmigrant visa, or (2) refugee or legal permanent resident status.</summary>
