  <summary date="2017-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stem the Tide of Overdose Prevalence from Opiate Drugs Act of 2017 or as the STOP OD Act of 2017

This bill permits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award grants: (1) to expand educational efforts to prevent abuse of opioids, which are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin; (2) to promote treatment of persons who abuse opioids; and (3) to promote understanding of addiction.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may award grants to: (1) support first responders carrying and administering naloxone, which is a prescription drug used to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose; (2) establish processes for referral to treatment for opioid abuse; and (3) reimburse for testing for fentanyl in opioid overdoses and reporting the results to the CDC.

This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to impose a fee on persons convicted of drug offenses. Collected amounts are made available for the HHS grants in this bill.

Specified agencies must submit to the Office of E-Government and Information Technology of the Office of Management and Budget an inventory of agency data centers and a strategy to consolidate and optimize the data centers.

The bill revises reporting requirements for the Department of Defense (DOD) regarding data centers. DOD and the Director of National Intelligence may waive this bill's data center requirements for any national security system.

The bill sets forth requirements for the Office of E-Government and Information Technology, including that the office must publish a goal for cost savings and optimization.

The bill's provisions regarding data centers are repealed at the start of FY2021.</summary>
