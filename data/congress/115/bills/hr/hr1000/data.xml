  <summary date="2017-02-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Humphrey-Hawkins 21st Century Full Employment and Training Act of 2017 or the Jobs for All Act

 This bill directs the Department of Labor to establish a Full Employment National Trust Fund with two separate accounts for: (1) Employment Opportunity Grants to states, Indian tribes, local governments, publicly-funded elementary and secondary educational institutions, educational institutions in the Federal Work-Study Program, and tax-exempt non-profit organizations for job-creating activities in communities whose economy is not at a level of full employment; and (2) Workforce Investment programs.

Labor is required, through studies it conducts or through independent studies, to:

 review the effectiveness of job training and job creation programs under this bill, disseminate information concerning best practices for achieving the bill's goals, and acquire a better understanding of such programs' true cost. Arbitration procedures are established for resolution of disputes for grant recipients. Labor is required to post a whistleblower hotline on its website for the public to report noncompliance with the bill's requirements.

 Labor must convene an annual national employment conference to discuss this bill's role in addressing all aspects of unemployment problems, the sharing of best practices in addressing them, and the discussion of problems in the administration of this bill.

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is amended to revise member composition requirements for state and local workforce development boards to include at least 25% of the chief executive officers of minority-serving, community-based organizations.

The Internal Revenue Code is amended to impose a tax on the transfer of ownership in certain covered securities transactions, payable by trading facilities or brokers that deal in such transactions. A penalty is imposed against persons who fail to include such transactions on any tax return or statement.

Labor shall suspend new hiring of unemployed persons and freeze the hourly wages paid for jobs funded under this bill whenever it is determined that:

 the unemployment rate is less than 4%, and the consumer price index (inflation) is greater than 3%.</summary>
