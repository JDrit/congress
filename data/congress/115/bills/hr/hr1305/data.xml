This bill requires the Department of Commerce to include in instructions for completing any survey relating to the Census a statement that answering any questions other than questions that elicit the name of the respondent, contact information, the date of the response, or the number of people living or staying at the same address where the respondent resides is optional. No person may be fined or otherwise compelled to answer questions in connection with the survey commonly known as the American Community Survey (except for the questions permitted by this bill).</summary>
