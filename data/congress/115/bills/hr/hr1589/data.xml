 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the health care insurance premium assistance tax credit, to adjust by a specified percentage the poverty line cap used to determine the eligibility of low-income taxpayers whose principal residence is located in a high cost area for such credit. The bill defines "specified percentage" as the product of 400% (the current poverty line cap) and the Supplemental Poverty Measure adjustment for the high cost area as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau.</summary>
