  <summary date="2017-03-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act

This bill directs U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ensure that ICE and CBP agents and officers wear body cameras when engaged in official operations. ICE and CBP must establish: (1) policies for the use of such cameras, and (2) procedures for carrying out adverse actions for noncompliance with such policies.

Such cameras must be on for an agent's or officer's entire shift.

Footage collected by such a body camera shall be made available to each party to any administrative proceeding, civil action, or criminal prosecution to which it pertains. If such footage is not made available, such a party may notify ICE or CBP in writing for purposes of instigating an adverse action for noncompliance.

DHS shall commence a rulemaking regarding the use of body cameras and the provision of footage that is consistent with the "Civil Rights Principles for Body Worn Cameras" of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, May 2015.

An ICE or CBP agent or officer whose body camera does not record footage in violation of this bill shall be subject to furlough, reduction in pay or grade, or a suspension of up to 30 days. If a body camera does not record at a time when the camera is required to be active, DHS may not determine that the camera suffered a malfunction unless the agent or officer submits evidence sufficient to establish that a malfunction occurred.</summary>
