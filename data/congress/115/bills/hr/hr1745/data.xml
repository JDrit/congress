This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to eliminate the sequestration, or automatic spending cuts, scheduled to occur because the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to recommend legislation to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 years, as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.</summary>
