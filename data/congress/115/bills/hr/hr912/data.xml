  <summary date="2017-02-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Protecting Immigrants From Legal Exploitation Act of 2017

 This bill amends the federal criminal code to subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both any individual who: (1) knowingly or recklessly executes a scheme in connection with any federal immigration law-related matter to defraud a person or to obtain money or anything else of value from a person by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises; or (2) knowingly and falsely represents that such individual is an attorney or an accredited representative in any federal immigration law-related matter.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall promulgate regulations, forms, and procedures defining the circumstances in which: (1) persons submitting immigration documents must identify who (other than immediate family members) assisted them in preparing or translating such documents; and (2) any person who received compensation (other than a normal fee for copying, mailing, or similar services) in connection with the preparation or submission of such documents must sign the documents as a preparer and provide identifying information.

DOJ may bring a civil injunction against an immigration service provider who engages in fraudulent conduct that substantially interferes with the administration of the immigration laws or who willfully misrepresents such provider's legal authority to provide representation before DOJ or DHS.

An alien may withdraw an immigration submission if the alien: (1) submits information indicating that thesubmission was prepared or submitted by an individual engaged in the unauthorized practice of law or immigration practitioner fraud, and (2) attests that he or she had no prior knowledge that the submission was prepared or submitted by such an individual.

This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to waive the bar on reentry for an alien who left the United States based on the erroneous advice of an individual engaged in the unauthorized practice of law or immigration practitioner fraud.

DOJ and DHS shall: (1) carry out, through the Director of the Office for Immigration Review, an outreach program to educate aliens regarding who may provide legal services and representation in immigration proceedings; and (2) establish, within the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, programs to award grants to eligible nonprofit organizations for direct legal services to aliens.</summary>
