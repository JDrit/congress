This bill amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act:

 to revise the definition of "missing child" to mean an individual under 18 years of age whose whereabouts are unknown to the individual's parent (currently, legal custodian); to specify that a parent includes a legal guardian or an individual who functions as a parent (e.g., a grandparent); to revise the functions and duties of the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC); and to require the NCMEC to make publicly available the annual report on missing children and the incidence of attempted child abductions.</summary>
