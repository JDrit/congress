This bilil establishes English as the official language of the United States.

Naturalization ceremonies and official functions of the U.S. government, subject to exceptions, must be conducted in English.

The bill declares that all citizens should be able to read and understand generally the English language text of U.S. laws.

A person injured by a violation of this bill may obtain relief, including a declaratory judgment, in a civil action.

English language requirements and workplace policies, whether in the public or private sector,&#160;shall be presumptively consistent with U.S. laws. Any ambiguity in&#160;U.S. laws&#160;shall be resolved in accordance with the rights retained by the people and the powers reserved to states under the Bill of Rights.

The Department of Homeland Security shall issue a proposed rule for uniform testing of the English language ability of candidates for naturalization based upon the principles that: (1) all citizens should be able to read and understand generally the English language text of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the laws of the United States; and (2) any exceptions to this standard should be limited to extraordinary circumstances, such as asylum.</summary>
