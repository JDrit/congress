  <summary date="2017-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Financial CHOICE Act of 2017

This bill&#160;amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, among other Acts,&#160;to:

 repeal Volcker Rule restrictions on certain speculative investments by banks; with respect to winding down failing banks,&#160;eliminate&#160;the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's orderly liquidation authority and establish new provisions regarding financial institution bankruptcy; and repeal Durbin Amendment limitations on fees that may be charged to retailers for debit card processing. Certain banks may exempt themselves from specified regulatory standards if they maintain a certain ratio of capital to total assets and meet other specified requirements.

 The bill removes the Financial Stability Oversight Council's authority to designate non-bank financial institutions and financial market utilities as "systemically important" (also known as "too big to fail").&#160;Under current law,&#160;entities so designated are subject to additional regulatory restrictions.&#160;Designations made previously are retroactively repealed.&#160;

 The bill also amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to:

 convert the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into a consumer law enforcement agency; subject&#160;the agency&#160;to the congressional appropriations process, expanded judicial review, and additional congressional oversight;&#160; eliminate supervisory authority over financial institutions; and limit the agency's authority to take action against entities for abusive practices.&#160; In addition, the bill:

 modifies provisions related to the Securities and Exchange Commission's managerial structure and enforcement authority; eliminates the Office of Financial Research within the Department of the Treasury; and revises&#160;provisions related to capital formation, insurance regulation, civil penalties for securities laws violations, and community financial institutions.</summary>
