This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that each wheelchair furnished to a veteran because of a service-connected disability restores the maximum achievable mobility and function in the activities of daily life, employment, and recreation. The VA may furnish a wheelchair to a veteran because the wheelchair restores an ability that relates exclusively to participation in a recreational activity.</summary>
