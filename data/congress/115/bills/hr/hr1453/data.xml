This bill prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from changing the name of its Countering Violent Extremism Task Force.

DHS: (1) may not make grants to counter Islamist extremism in an aggregate amount of more than $4 million in any fiscal year, and (2) shall ensure that any such grants made for a fiscal year are closely matched in aggregate dollar amounts in grants made to counter other forms of extremism for such fiscal year.</summary>
