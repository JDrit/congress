This bill declares that U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 shall have no force or effect under U.S. law, and the United States shall not be bound by any provision of such resolution.

 Resolution 2334 characterizes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as illegal and demands cessation of settlement activities.

Nothing in such resolution or in any subsequently adopted Security Council resolution relating to Israel may be used to establish or demonstrate the existence of a violation of U.S. law or an offence against the law of nations in U.S. courts, including by giving standing, a cause of action, or a source of damages.

Any reference to Israel in U.S. law, or in any treaty or other international agreement to which both the United States and Israel are parties, shall be interpreted to include any territory over which Israel exercises civil jurisdiction, including East Jerusalem, Areas "C" and "H2" of the West Bank, and the Golan Heights.</summary>
