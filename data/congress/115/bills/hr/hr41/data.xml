  <summary date="2017-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Preventing Overreach Within the Executive Rulemaking System Act of 2017 or the POWERS Act of 2017

This bill prohibits publication or service of a rule for 60 days following the date of the publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking for such rule.

If, during such period, a House or Senate committee that has jurisdiction over the provision of law authorizing the rule submits written data, views, or arguments to the agency, it shall, within 10 days, publish a response in the Federal Register. (The period beginning on the date of such submission and ending on the date of such publication shall not count as part of the 60-day period during which publication or service of the rule is prohibited.)

The 10-day response requirement shall not apply to a subsequent committee submission if the agency: (1) determines that such subsequent submission fails to address the content of such response or raises issues that were not raised in the initial submission or the response, and (2) notifies the committee of such determination.</summary>
