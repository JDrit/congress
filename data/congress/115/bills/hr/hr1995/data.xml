This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation to&#160;expand testing of&#160;a model of Medicare Advantage (MA) value-based insurance design that allows MA plans to propose and design benefit structures that vary benefits, cost-sharing, and supplemental benefits with respect to enrollees who have specific chronic diseases. The test model (initially being carried out in specified states)&#160;shall be&#160;expanded to all states, and may not be terminated prior to 2022.</summary>
