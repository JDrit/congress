This bill amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, and the Export Administration Act of 1979, with respect to the rescission of a determination of a country as a state sponsor of terrorism, to require that the President has submitted to Congress a report justifying such rescission 90 days (currently 45 days) prior to the rescission taking effect, which certifies that the government concerned has not provided support for international terrorism during the preceding 24 months (currently 6 months).

No such rescission under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Export Administration Act of 1979 may be made if Congress, within 90 days after receipt of such a presidential report, enacts a joint resolution pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act prohibiting such rescission.</summary>
