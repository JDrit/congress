This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the license holder of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug or biological product from restricting availability of the medication for testing by a product developer seeking to develop a drug, generic drug, or biosimilar, including restricting availability with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS).

Upon request, the license holder of a medication that is not subject to a REMS must provide a product developer with the medication for testing.

For a medication subject to a REMS, a product developer must have FDA authorization to obtain the medication before the license holder must provide it. The FDA may authorize a product developer to conduct testing and clinical trials with the medication.

A wholesaler or specialty distributor who receives a request from a product developer for a medication for testing may not disclose to the license holder the identity of the product developer. The FDA may prohibit or limit transfer of a medication to a product developer if the transfer poses an imminent hazard to public health.

License holders are not liable for claims arising from a product developer testing a medication.

The FDA may waive the requirement that a medication use a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use with a comparable approved medication if the product developer is unable to finalize terms for a shared system with the license holder of the approved medication.</summary>
