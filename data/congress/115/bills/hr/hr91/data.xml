Building Supportive Networks for Women Veterans Act

(Sec. 2) This bill makes permanent the requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out, through the Readjustment Counseling Service of the Veterans Health Administration, a program to provide reintegration and readjustment services in group retreat settings to women veterans who are recently separated from service after a prolonged deployment. (Currently, such program is required as a pilot program under the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.)</summary>
