  <summary date="2017-01-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Airplane Impacts Mitigation Act of 2017 or the AIM Act of 2017

This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enter into an agreement with an eligible institution of higher education to conduct a study of the health impacts of airplane flights on residents exposed to a range of noise and air pollution levels from such flights.

The study shall:

 focus on residents in Boston, Chicago, New York, the northern California metroplex, Phoenix, and not more than three additional metropolitan areas that each contain at least one international airport; consider the health impacts on residents living partly or wholly within the land area underneath the flight paths most frequently used by aircraft flying below 10,000 feet; and consider only those health impacts that manifest during the physical implementation of the NextGen RNAV program on flights departing from or arriving at an international airport located in one of such metropolitan areas. An institution of higher education is eligible to conduct the study if it:

 has a school of public health that has participated in the FAA Center of Excellence for Aircraft Noise and Aviation Emissions Mitigation, has a Center for Environmental Health that receives funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, is located in one of the areas within the scope of the study, applies to the FAA in a timely fashion, demonstrates that it is qualified to conduct such a study, and agrees to submit its findings to the FAA within two years after entering into such an agreement.</summary>
