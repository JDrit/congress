  <summary date="2017-03-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act of 2017

This bill expands eligibility for the family caregiver program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to include members of the Armed Forces or veterans who are seriously injured or who became ill on active duty prior to September 11, 2001 (currently, limited to service after September 11, 2001).

Services to caregivers of veterans under such program are expanded to include&#160;child care services, financial planning services, and legal services.

 The bill terminates the support program for caregivers of covered veterans on October 1, 2022, except that any caregiver activities carried out on September 30, 2022, shall be continued on and after October 1, 2022.

The bill authorizes the transfer of entitlement to post 9/11 education assistance to family members by veterans who are retired for a physical disability or&#160;who are seriously injured veterans in need of family caregiver services, without regard to length-of-service requirements.

The VA is authorized to pay monthly special compensation to seriously injured or ill veterans in need of personal care services and to their caregivers.

Flexible work schedules or telework&#160;are authorized for federal employees who are caregivers of veterans.

The Public Health Service Act is amended to&#160;designate a veteran participating in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers as an adult with a special need for purposes of the&#160;lifespan respite care program.

An interagency working group is established in the executive branch to review and report on policies relating to the caregivers of veterans and members of the Armed Forces.

The VA shall provide for studies on members of the Armed Forces who commenced service after September 11, 2001, and veterans who have incurred a serious injury or illness, including a mental health injury, and their caregivers.</summary>
