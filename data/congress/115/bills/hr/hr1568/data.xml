This bill establishes a national hiring standard for motor carriers.

The bill defines an"entity" as a person acting as:

 a shipper (excluding an individual shipper) or a consignee; a broker, a freight forwarder, or a household goods freight forwarder; a non-vessel-operating common carrier, an ocean freight forwarder, or an ocean transportation intermediary; an indirect air carrier authorized to operate under a Standard Security Program approved by the Transportation Security Administration; a federally licensed customs broker; an interchange motor carrier; or a warehouse. Before tendering a shipment, but not more than 35 days before the pickup of a shipment by the hired motor carrier, an entity shall verify that the carrier:

 is registered with and authorized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to operate as a motor carrier or household goods motor carrier, has the minimum insurance coverage required by federal law, and does not have an unsatisfactory safety fitness rating issued by the FMCSA and has not otherwise been ordered to discontinue operations. Only evidence of an entity's compliance with this bill may be admitted as evidence in a civil action for damages resulting from a case or proceeding in which it is alleged that such entity's selection or retention of a motor carrier was negligent. No other motor carrier data created or maintained by the FMCSA, including safety measurement system data or analysis of such data, may be admitted in such case or proceeding.</summary>
