This bill amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to require the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to make grants to community development financial institutions for: (1)&#160;the establishment of loan-loss reserve funds to defray the costs of small business lending, and (2) related technical assistance.

A community development financial institution must provide nonfederal matching funds equal to 50% of the amount of any grant received.

A grantee may not&#160;use grant funds to make direct loans to small businesses.</summary>
