This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to tax-exempt private activity bond financing, to: (1) eliminate a provision that restricts nonprofit scholarship funding corporations that acquire student loan notes to notes incurred under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (thus allowing such corporations to access tax-exempt financing for other types of student loans), and (2) expand the operations of such corporations to include performing student assistance related activities.</summary>
