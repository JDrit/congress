  <summary date="2017-06-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act of 2017

This bill prohibits the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, and the Council on Environmental Quality from considering the social cost of carbon, methane, nitrous oxide, or greenhouse gas as part of any cost benefit analysis in the rule making process, unless a federal law is enacted authorizing such consideration. They may also consider those social costs if they: (1) use an estimate that complies with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget's "Circular A-4" document; (2) use the discount rates of three and seven percent specified in that document; (3) consider only the domestic costs and benefits of the activity; and (4) use only the most up to date and empirically estimated equilibrium climate sensitivity distributions, and realistic time horizons.

The EPA must report on the number of proposed and final rulemakings, guidance documents, and agency actions since January 2009 that use those social costs, including as part of any cost benefit analysis required under Executive Order 12866 or other relevant authority.</summary>
