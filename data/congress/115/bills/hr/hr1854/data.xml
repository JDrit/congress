  <summary date="2017-04-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Prescription Drug Monitoring Act of 2017

This bill requires a state that receives grant funds under the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) or the controlled substance monitoring program to comply with specified requirements, including a requirement to share its PDMP data with other states. The Department of Justice (DOJ) or Department of Health and Human Services may withhold grant funds from a state that fails to comply.

 To facilitate data sharing among states, the bill directs DOJ to award a grant under the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program to establish and maintain a data-sharing hub.</summary>
