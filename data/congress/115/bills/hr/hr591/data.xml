This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to declare that all deposits into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account shall remain available to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (currently, the Department of Justice [DOJ]) for reimbursement of administrative expenses to the extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to declare that certain foreign student and exchange program fees that are deposited into the account shall remain available to DHS (currently, DOJ) for reimbursement of administrative expenses (including expenses related to gathering foreign student information) to the extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</summary>
