This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to states with a volunteer health care provider law that permits a volunteer to provide health care services without being licensed in the state if the volunteer is licensed in another state.

The law must: (1) require the services to be provided in a rural or impoverished area and to be within the scope of practice of the provider in the state, and (2) prohibit the services from being provided for more than seven consecutive days.</summary>
