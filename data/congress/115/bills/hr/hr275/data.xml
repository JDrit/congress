  <summary date="2017-01-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fairness for Crime Victims Act of 2017 

This bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish points of order in the House of Representatives and the Senate against considering appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) that would cause the amount available for obligation during the fiscal year from the Crime Victims Fund to be less than the three-year average.

A CHIMP is a provision that: (1) would have been estimated as affecting direct spending or receipts if the provision were included in legislation other than an appropriations bill; and (2) results in a net decrease in budget authority in the current year or the budget year, but does not result in a net decrease in outlays over the period of the total of the current year, the budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently adopted budget resolution.</summary>
