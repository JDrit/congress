  <summary date="2017-05-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Climate Solutions Commission Act of 2017

This bill establishes a bipartisan National Climate Solutions Commission that must:

 undertake a comprehensive review of economically viable actions or policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States; make recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the President, Congress, and the states; and use as its goals for emissions reductions those estimated rates of reduction that reflect the latest scientific findings of what is needed to avoid serious human health and environmental consequences of a changing climate. In order to be eligible for membership on the commission, an individual must be a representative from: (1) nongovernmental organizations with expertise in the economy, energy, climate, or public health; or (2) industry organizations from relevant sectors.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must conduct a study of programs, financial tools, and institutions that are focused on: (1) reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions; or (2) encouraging the research, development, prototyping, and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. The GAO must then report on: (1) the study results; and (2) an assessment of those financial tools, policies, and institutions that are most successful at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while protecting economic growth and employment.</summary>
