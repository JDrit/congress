 This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) establish and oversee a national system to accurately determine the incidence of sports-related concussions among youth, and (2) begin implementation of such system within one year of this bill's enactment.

The data collected shall include:

 the incidence of sports related concussions in individuals 5 through 21 years of age; demographic information of the injured individuals; pre-existing conditions of the injured individuals; the concussion history of the injured individuals; the use of protective equipment and impact monitoring devices; the qualifications of personnel diagnosing the concussions; and the cause, nature, and extent of the concussive injury. The National Institutes of Health must conduct or support:

 research designed to inform the creation of guidelines for the management of short- and long-term sequelae of concussion in youth; research on the effects of concussions and repetitive head impacts on quality of life and the activities of daily living; research to identify predictors, and modifiers of outcomes, of concussions in youth; and research on age- and sex-related biomechanical determinants of injury risk for concussion in youth. The CDC shall develop and disseminate to the public information regarding concussions.

The bill establishes a Concussion Research Commission, which shall study the programs and activities conducted pursuant to this bill and formulate systemic recommendations to increase knowledge about, and change the culture surrounding, concussions.</summary>
