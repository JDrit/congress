 This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish a program to prohibit all but specified authorized individuals from possessing a firearm at a covered airport, including any individual who enters the airport, or exits public transportation at it, for air travel, meeting another individual, picking up cargo, or employment.

 The TSA shall require airport operators to:

 display conspicuous notices summarizing the program at each airport entrance, and require law enforcement personnel to monitor the airport to prevent violations and escort air travelers who are authorized to carry a firearm. The bill prescribes criminal penalties for nonauthorized individuals who knowingly possess a firearm at a covered airport.</summary>
