This bill establishes new programs or amends existing programs related to workforce and community development. It directs: (1) the Department of Labor to award grants for job skills training for older individuals (age 45 or older) and for workers in highly-skilled industries; and (2) the Department of Education to award scholarships to students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) and teaching certifications. The bill also amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand and extend the work opportunity tax credit and to allow tax credits for wages paid to interns by small business owners.

With respect to community development, the bill allows the first-time homebuyer tax credit to be used to purchase a residence in an economically distressed community. It requires the Small Business Administration to make grants for commercial investment in economically underserved communities and direct loans to small business concerns. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend and increase the new markets tax credit. The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on efforts to expand access to broadband service.

The bill establishes a Commission on Innovation in the Office of Management and Budget to study new and developing technologies.

The Department of Health and Human Services must: (1) study characteristics of populations that do not have health insurance coverage, and (2) award grants for free dental health services in underserved communities.</summary>
