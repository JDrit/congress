  <summary date="2017-04-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act of 2017

This bill amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to require the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to consider small businesses when it facilitates and supports the development of voluntary, consensus-based, industry-led guidelines and procedures to cost-effectively reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.

NIST must consult with other federal agencies to disseminate, and publish on its website, standard and method resources that small business may use voluntarily to help identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks. The resources must be: (1) technology-neutral, (2) based on international standards to the extent possible, (3) able to vary with the nature and size of the implementing small business and the sensitivity of the data collected or stored on the information systems, (4) capable of promoting awareness of third-party stakeholder relationships to assist small businesses in mitigating common cybersecurity risks, and (5) consistent with the national cybersecurity awareness and education program under the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014.

Other federal agencies may elect to publish the resources on their own websites.</summary>
