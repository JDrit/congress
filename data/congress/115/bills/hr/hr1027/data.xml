This bill amends titles XIX (Medicaid) and&#160;XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) of the Social Security Act to:

 establish a grant program for school-based health centers to, with respect to children who are eligible for&#160;Medicaid and CHIP,&#160;facilitate access to services and&#160;encourage the adoption of&#160;healthy behaviors; establish a demonstration program for the provision or expansion of telehealth services in school-based health centers; and require state Medicaid and CHIP programs to cover services furnished by school-based health centers. In addition, the bill amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize through FY2022 and revise school-based health center programs.&#160;

The bill also amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to specify that&#160;school-based health centers are essential community providers for purposes of inclusion in a qualified health plan.</summary>
