  <summary date="2017-02-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that:

 those individuals responsible for the July 1999 murders of U.S. citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in Serbia should be brought to justice; it is reprehensible that no individual has ever been found guilty of executing the Bytyqi brothers or of any other crimes associated with their deaths and that no individual is facing charges for these crimes; the government of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices, including the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office, should make it a priority to investigate and prosecute officials believed to be responsible for those deaths; and progress in resolving this case should remain a significant factor determining the further development of U.S.-Serbian relations.</summary>
