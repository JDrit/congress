  <summary date="2017-03-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should seek the elimination of all subsidies benefiting the production or export of sugar by any foreign country that:

 exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar in 2014, 2015, or 2016, or has in effect a free trade agreement with the United States. Urges the President to:

 report to Congress detailed information about how any of such country has eliminated such subsidies; and propose legislation to implement U.S. sugar policy reforms.</summary>
