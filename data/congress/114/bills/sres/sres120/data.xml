  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends Rule XXII (Precedence of Motions) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to consider cloture of debate to have been invoked unless one more than two-fifths of all Senators votes in the negative. (The two-thirds affirmative vote requirement remains for measures or motions to amend the Senate rules.)

Declares that cloture fails, and it is in order for the Majority Leader (or a designee) to initiate extended debate on the measure in question, if the vote to close debate is decided in the affirmative by a majority of Senators voting, a quorum being present, and in the negative by more than two-fifths of all Senators.

Prescribes related procedures with respect to extended debate.</summary>
