 Calls on the government of Iran to release the seven imprisoned Baha'i leaders, the nine imprisoned Baha'i educators, and all other prisoners held solely on account of their religion.

 Calls on the President and Secretary of State, in cooperation with responsible nations, to condemn the government of Iran's continued violation of human rights and demand the release of prisoners held solely on account of their religion.

Urges the President and the Secretary to utilize available authorities, including the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, to impose sanctions on officials of the government of Iran and other individuals directly responsible for serious human rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i community of Iran.</summary>
