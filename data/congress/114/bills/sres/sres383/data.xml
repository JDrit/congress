  <summary date="2016-04-27T19:22:56Z" status="Passed Senate amended">Affirms that the U.S.-Israel economic partnership has benefitted both countries and is a foundational component of the strong alliance.

Recognizes that science and technology innovation present promising new frontiers for U.S.-Israel economic cooperation, particularly in light of widespread drought, cybersecurity attacks, and other major challenges impacting the United States.

Encourages the President to regularize and expand forums of economic dialogue with Israel, foster public and private sector participation and investment, and remove barriers to, and provide incentives for, private sector market entry.

Supports the exploration of new agreements with Israel, including in the fields of energy, water, agriculture, medicine, neurotechnology and cybersecurity.</summary>
