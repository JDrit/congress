  <summary date="2016-06-28T13:06:09Z" status="Reported to Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Reaffirms the commitment of the United States to promote the safety and well-being of the millions of refugees who flee war, persecution, or torture in search of peace, hope, and freedom.

Calls upon the U.S. government to: (1) continue its international leadership role in response to those who have been displaced, (2) find solutions to existing conflicts and prevent new conflicts, (3) provide humanitarian and development support to countries that are hosting millions of refugees, and (4) encourage the international community to increase resources to address current and projected refugee crises.

Commends those who have risked their lives working individually and for nongovernmental organizations and international agencies that have provided life-saving assistance and helped protect those displaced by conflict.

Reiterates the bipartisan U.S. commitment to protect and assist refugees and other forcibly uprooted persons.</summary>
