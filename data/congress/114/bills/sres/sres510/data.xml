  <summary date="2016-06-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Recognizes the increase in educational opportunities, including in sports, for women and girls since the passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

Commends the work of the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to ensure that students have a safe learning environment by working to ensure that schools prevent and respond to discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, including dating violence, pregnancy, sex-stereotyping, and discrimination based on actual or perceived gender identity.

Recognizes that progress must still be made to ensure that no educational institution that receives federal education funding discriminates against any persons because of their sex.</summary>
