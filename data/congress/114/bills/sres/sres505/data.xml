Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) restrictions upon the ability of Open Skies Treaty aircraft to overfly all portions of a State Party's territory impede openness of military forces and undermine confidence; (2) the Russian Federation's overfly restrictions constitute treaty violations; and (3) the United States should take measures to bring about the Russian Federation's return to full compliance with its treaty obligations, including by restricting Russian overflights of the United States.</summary>
