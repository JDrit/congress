  <summary date="2016-06-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Public Water Supply Invasive Species Compliance Act of 2016

This bill amends the Lacey Act and Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 by exempting certain water transfers between public water supplies located on, along, or across the boundaries of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana from prohibitions on illegal trade of plants and wildlife. Specifically, the prohibitions do not apply to covered water transfers containing a prohibited species if: (1) the species are present in both public water supplies before the transfer and the water is transferred directly between them; or (2) the water is transferred in a closed conveyance system (a closed system that collects, contains, and transports the flow of water, e.g., pipe systems) and sent directly to treatment facilities where the species will be destroyed.</summary>
