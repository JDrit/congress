This bill amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare) to establish a demonstration project through which primary care practices may receive incentives for referring diabetic Medicare beneficiaries to local eye doctors for comprehensive dilated eye exams. The project must test the extent to which these incentives: (1) improve early detection and treatment of diabetes-related vision problems, (2) reduce the cost of Medicare services, and (3) achieve beneficiary satisfaction.

The project&#160;shall identify for participation at least 100 primary care practices in at least 10 states that have high per capita costs of diabetes care for Medicare beneficiaries.

Project costs shall be paid from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.</summary>
