  <summary date="2016-05-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill deauthorizes the Salt Creek project for flood control, environmental restoration, and recreation in Graham, Texas, authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 1999.

The non-federal sponsor for the project shall hold the United States harmless from any claim in connection with the project.

The U.S Army Corps of Engineers is authorized to transfer any land acquired by the federal government for the project on behalf of the non-federal sponsor that remains in federal ownership after this bill's enactment to the non-federal sponsor.

If land that is integral to the project ceases to be owned by the public, all rights to the land and improvements shall revert to the United States, at the Corps' discretion.</summary>
