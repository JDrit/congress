          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thoroughly Investigating Retaliation Against Whistleblowers Act</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 to reauthorize through FY2020 the Office of Special Counsel (official appointed by the President to protect federal employees, former employees, and applicants for employment from prohibited personnel practices). </p> <p>The Office of Special Counsel shall have access to any record or other information of any agency under its jurisdiction.</p> <p>The bill: (1) extends from 15 to 45 days the period for the review by the Office of Special Counsel of a disclosed prohibited practice, (2) requires an agency to provide a detailed explanation of any failure to take action to address information about a prohibited practice transmitted to it by the Special Counsel, and (3) requires an agency that reports agency action proposed as a result of its investigation of such information to submit a supplemental report within 180 days on whether such proposed action has been taken and, if not, why not.</p> <p>The Office of Special Counsel may terminate an investigation of a prohibited practice if: (1) it involves an allegation that has been previously made by the same person, (2) the Office does not have jurisdiction to investigate such allegation, or (3) the person should have known of the alleged prohibited personnel practice earlier than three years before the Special Counsel received the allegation. </p> <p>The bill expands the annual reporting requirements of the Office of Special Counsel. </p> <p>The Office of Special Counsel shall design and establish a survey pilot program in FY2017-FY2018 of individuals who have filed a complaint or disclosure with the Office. </p> <p>Penalties for violations of the Hatch Act may include a combination of the disciplinary actions and the civil penalty prescribed under current law.</p>]]></text>
