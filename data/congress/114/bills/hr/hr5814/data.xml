This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify the federal student loan discharge process for a veteran who has a total and permanent disability.

Specifically, it directs the Department of Education (ED) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a computer matching program for ED to identify the borrowers who have been assigned a service-connected disability rating of 100% by the VA.

ED must notify such borrowers of their eligibility for federal student loan discharge and provide simple instructions for applying.</summary>
