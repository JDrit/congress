This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to develop and publish a list of countries that are tax havens for corporations.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the penalties on corporations for: (1) underpayment of tax involving an undisclosed foreign financial asset located in a tax haven country; (2) reportable transaction understatements involving transactions in a tax haven country; and (3) fraud, tax evasion, or false statements involving transactions in a tax haven country.

The bill: (1) grants a preference in the award of federal contracts to contractors who have not engaged in outsourcing, and (2) defines "outsourcing" as the laying off of a U.S. worker from a job and the hiring or contracting for the same job to be performed in a foreign country.

Revenues generated by this Act must be set aside for the reduction of the public debt.</summary>
