  <summary date="2015-07-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medical Controlled Substances Transportation Act of 2015

This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow a physician to transport controlled substances to another practice setting or disaster area if the physician is registered to dispense, or conduct research with, controlled substances listed on schedules II, III, IV, or V, and the physician enters into a specific agreement with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

The agreement must require a physician to provide advance notification to the DEA, limit the duration of transport to 72 hours, and maintain records of the controlled substances dispensed. A &#8220;disaster area&#8221; is the area covered by a President's major disaster declaration.</summary>
