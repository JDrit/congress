This bill authorizes the President to provide technical and financial assistance for programs that: (1) improve Nepal's basic infrastructure following the earthquakes in affected communities; (2) support economic growth, including through agriculture and small-scale enterprise opportunities; (3) promote health and basic education programs; and (4) support democracy programs that promote political reforms, including strengthening democratic institutions and rule of law.

The U.S Agency for International Development shall report to Congress regarding:
