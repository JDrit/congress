<LI>complies with medical requirements associated with that license; <LI>holds an FAA medical certificate on the date of enactment of this bill, held such a certificate at any point during the 10-year period preceding the date of enactment, or obtains one after the date of enactment; <LI>is transporting five or fewer passengers, and <LI>is operating under visual or instrument flight rules. </LI> </UL> <p>The most recent FAA medical certificate to the individual:</p> <UL> <LI>must indicate whether it is first, second, or third class; <LI>may include authorization for special issuance; <LI>may be expired; <LI>cannot have been revoked or suspended; and <LI>cannot have been withdrawn. </LI> </UL> <p>The individual's most recent application to the FAA for airman medical certification cannot have been denied.</p> <p>The individual must also have completed an Internet medical education course, meeting specified criteria and free of charge, during the 24 calendar months before acting as pilot in command of a covered aircraft. Successful completion of the course shall trigger an electronic release authorizing the National Driver Register through a designated state department of motor vehicles to furnish the FAA with information about the individual's driving record.</p> <p>If diagnosed with any medical condition that may impact ability to fly, the individual must, when serving as a pilot in command, be under a physician's care and treatment.</p> <p>The individual must have received a comprehensive medical examination from a state-licensed physician during the previous 48 months and met certain pre-examination requirements involving a checklist of medical conditions and medications. </p> <p>An individual who has qualified for the third-class medical certificate exemption and is seeking to serve as a pilot in command of a covered aircraft shall be required to have completed the process for obtaining an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate for each of a specified list of mental health disorders, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular conditions. The bill prescribes special rules for such disorders and conditions. <p>The FAA shall review and identify additional medical conditions that could be added to the Conditions Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs) Can Issue (CACI) program (which allows AMEs to issue airman medical certificates that previously had to be deferred to the Aerospace Medical Certification Division or the Regional Flight Surgeon's Office for further review). <p>The FAA shall also implement procedures to expedite the process for obtaining an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate. <p>Beginning one year after enactment of this bill, the FAA may not take an enforcement action for not holding a valid third-class medical certificate against a pilot of a covered aircraft for a flight, if the pilot and the flight meet, through a good faith effort, certain requirements, unless the FAA has published in the Federal Register final regulations for the medical certification of small aircraft pilots. <p>A "covered aircraft" is one that: <UL> <LI>is authorized under federal law to carry not more than six occupants, and <LI>has a maximum certificated takeoff weight of no more than 6,000 pounds. </LI> </UL> <p>The requirements of this section shall not apply to pilots electing to operate under regulations for operations not requiring a medical certificate or for operations requiring either a medical certificate or U.S. driver's license.</p> <p>If it receives credible or urgent information, including from the National Driver Register or the FAA Safety Hotline, that reflects on an individual's ability to safely operate a covered aircraft under the third-class medical certificate exemption, the FAA may require the individual to provide additional information or history so that it may determine whether the individual is safe to continue operating a covered aircraft. The FAA may use such information to request an individual to provide additional information or to take actions to amend, modify, suspend, or revoke the individual's airman certificate.</p> <p>(Sec. 2308) The bill revises requirements for air carrier and airport operator emergency contingency plans to require an air carrier to deplane an aircraft and return to the airport terminal when there is an excessive tarmac delay within:</p> <ul> <li> three hours after the main aircraft door closes in the case of a domestic flight, and</li> <li>four hours after the main door closes in the case of an international flight.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 2309) DOT shall review and, if appropriate, establish a policy to require all air carriers to establish a policy that enables a child, age 13 or under on a scheduled flight, to be seated in a seat adjacent to the seat of an accompanying family member over age 13, except when assignment to an adjacent seat would require an upgrade to another cabin class or a seat with extra legroom or seat pitch for an additional charge.</p> <p>TITLE III--AVIATION SECURITY </p> <p><i>Aviation Security Act of 2016</i></p> <p>Subtitle A--TSA PreCheck Expansion </p> <p>(Sec. 3101) The bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of DHS to continue to administer the Precheck Program (trusted traveler program).</p> <p> (Sec. 3102) The TSA shall publish application enrollment standards that add multiple private sector application capabilities for the PreCheck program to increase the public's enrollment access to such program.</p> <p>Upon publication of such standards, the TSA must:</p> <UL> <LI>coordinate with interested parties to deploy TSA-approved ready-to-market private sector solutions that meet such standards, make available additional enrollment capabilities, and offer secure online and mobile enrollment opportunities; <LI>partner with the private sector to collect biographic and biometric identification information via mobile enrollment platforms to increase enrollment flexibility and minimize the amount of travel to enrollment centers for applicants; <LI>ensure that any biometric and biographic information is collected in a manner that is comparable with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and that protects privacy and data security, including that any personally identifiable information is collected, retained, used, and shared in a manner consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974; <LI>ensure that the enrollment process is streamlined and flexible to allow an individual to provide additional information to complete enrollment and verify identity; <LI>ensure that any enrollment expansion using a private sector risk assessment is determined to be equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check conducted through the Federal Bureau of Investigation; <LI>ensure that the TSA has certified that reasonable procedures are in place with regard to accuracy of information employed in private sector risk assessments; <LI>develop and implement a continual process for approving private sector marketing of the PreCheck program and a long-term strategy for partnering with the private sector to encourage enrollment; and <LI>report on any PreCheck Program application fees collected in excess of the costs of administering the program, including assessment of its feasibility and recommendations for using such fees to support its marketing. </LI> </UL> <p>The TSA shall:</p> <UL> <LI>coordinate with the heads of appropriate DHS components to leverage DHS-held data and technologies to verify the citizenship of individuals enrolling in the Pre-Check program; <LI>partner with the private sector to use biometrics and authentication standards such as those developed by NIST to facilitate enrollment; <LI>consider leveraging existing airport resources to conduct fingerprint and background checks to expedite identity verification; <LI>ensure that PreCheck Program screening lanes are available during peak and high-volume travel times at airports to enrolled individuals; <LI>provide for expedited screening at standard screening lanes during times when PreCheck Program screening lanes are closed; and <LI>initiate an assessment to identify security vulnerabilities in the vetting process for the PreCheck program, including whether subjecting program participants to recurrent fingerprint-based criminal history records checks, in addition to recurrent checks against the terrorist watchlist, could be done in a cost-effective manner to strengthen the security of the program. </LI> </UL> <p>Subtitle B--Securing Aviation From Foreign Entry Points and Guarding Airports Through Enhanced Security </p> <p>(Sec. 3201) The TSA shall conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment of all last point of departure airports with nonstop flights to the United States.</p> <p>(Sec. 3202) The TSA shall submit to Congress and the GAO a plan: (1) to enhance collaboration, coordination, and information-sharing about international-inbound aviation between the United States and domestic and foreign partners in order to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports; and (2) that assesses the TSA's ability to enter into a mutual agreement with a foreign government entity to permit TSA representatives to conduct inspections of foreign airports without prior notice.</p> <p>The GAO shall review TSA efforts to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports and determine if the implementation of such efforts and capabilities effectively secures international-inbound aviation. </p> <p>(Sec. 3203) The TSA shall submit to Congress a comprehensive workforce assessment of all TSA personnel within its Office of Global Strategies or whose primary professional duties contribute to the TSA's global efforts to secure transportation security, including whether they are assigned in a risk-based, intelligence-driven manner. </p> <p>(Sec. 3204) The TSA may donate security screening equipment to a foreign last point of departure airport operator if the equipment can be expected to mitigate a specific vulnerability to U.S. security or U.S. citizens. </p> <p>The TSA shall provide to specified congressional committees within 30 days of any such donation a detailed written explanation of:</p> <UL> <LI>the specific vulnerability to the United States or U.S. citizens that will be mitigated by such donation, <LI>an explanation as to why the recipient of such donation is unable or unwilling to purchase security screening equipment to mitigate such vulnerability, <LI>an evacuation plan for sensitive technologies in case of emergency or instability in the country to which such donation is being made, <LI>how the TSA will ensure the security screening equipment that is being donated is used and maintained over the course of its life by the recipient, and <LI>the total dollar value of such donation. </LI> </UL> <p>(Sec. 3205) The TSA may evaluate foreign countries' air cargo programs to determine whether they provide a level of security commensurate with that required by U.S. air cargo security programs. If so, the TSA shall approve and officially recognize such country's program, in which case such country shall not be required to adhere to the U.S. programs that would otherwise be applicable. The bill provides for revocation or temporary suspension of approval and official recognition if the TSA determines that a country's program no longer provides a level of security commensurate with that required by U.S. air cargo security programs.</p> <p>The requirements of this section shall apply irrespective of whether cargo is transported on an aircraft of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, a cargo carrier, or a foreign cargo carrier.</p> <p>(Sec. 3206) The TSA shall establish an international training and capacity development program to train appropriate foreign government authorities in air transportation security.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Checkpoint Optimization and Efficiency</p> <p>(Sec. 3301) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that airport checkpoint wait times should not take priority over the security of the U.S. aviation system.</p> <p>(Sec. 3302) The TSA shall begin and complete, within 30 days after enactment of this bill, an assessment of its staffing allocation model to determine the necessary staffing positions, including use of canine explosives detection teams and technology, at all U.S. airports at which the TSA operates passenger checkpoints.</p> <p>The staffing allocation model shall be based on staffing levels necessary to maintain minimal passenger wait times and maximum security effectiveness.</p> <p>The TSA shall require each Federal Security Director to engage regularly with appropriate aviation security stakeholders to exchange information regarding airport and security operations.</p> <p>The GAO shall review the staffing allocation model.</p> <p>(Sec. 3303) The TSA shall also:</p> <UL> <LI>require Transportation Security Officers with appropriate certifications and training to be assigned to passenger and baggage security screening functions; <LI>use other TSA personnel who may not have certification and training to screen passengers or baggage for tasks not directly related to security screening, including restocking bins and giving instructions and support to passengers in security lines; <LI>assess headquarters personnel; and <LI>reassign appropriate personnel to assist with airport security screening activities on a permanent or temporary basis. </LI> </UL> <p>(Sec. 3304) Within 30 days after enactment of this bill, the TSA shall:</p> <UL> <LI>utilize TSA Behavior Detection Officers for passenger and baggage security screening, including the verification of traveler documents, particularly at designated PreCheck lanes to ensure that they are operational for use and maximum efficiency; <LI>make every practicable effort to grant additional flexibility and authority to Federal Security Directors in matters related to checkpoint and checked baggage staffing allocation and employee overtime in furtherance of maintaining minimal passenger wait times and maximum security effectiveness; <LI>disseminate to aviation security stakeholders and appropriate TSA personnel a list of checkpoint optimization best practices; and <LI>request the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make recommendations on best practices for checkpoint operations optimization. </UL> <p>By the same 30-day deadline, the TSA shall direct each Federal Security Director to coordinate local representatives of aviation security stakeholders to establish a staffing advisory working group at each airport at which the TSA oversees or performs passenger security screening to give recommendations to TSA on Transportation Security Officer staffing numbers. </p> <p>(Sec. 3305) The bill defines the term "aviation security stakeholders" to mean air carriers, airport operators, and labor organizations representing Transportation Security Officers or contract screeners.</p> <p>Subtitle D--Aviation Security Enhancement and Oversight </p> <p>(Sec. 3402) The TSA shall assess the level of risk posed to the domestic air transportation system by individuals with unescorted access to a secure area of an airport.</p> <p>(Sec. 3403) The TSA shall update DHS rules on access controls, considering specified matters.</p> <p>The TSA may encourage the issuance by airport and aircraft operators in a timely manner of free, one-time, 24-hour temporary credentials for workers who have timely reported their credentials missing, but not permanently lost, stolen, or destroyed, until replacement of such credentials is necessary.</p> <p>(Sec. 3404) The TSA shall issue guidance to airport operators for placing an expiration date on each airport credential issued to a non-U.S. citizen, which shall not exceed the period of time he or she is lawfully authorized to work in the United States.</p> <p>The TSA shall:</p> <UL> <LI>also issue guidance for transportation security inspectors to review annually the procedures of airport operators and air carriers for applicants seeking unescorted access to any Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA) of an airport; and <LI>make available to airport operators and air carriers information on identifying suspicious or fraudulent identification materials. </LI> </UL> <p>This guidance shall require a comprehensive review of background checks and employment authorization documents issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the review of procedures.</p> <p>(Sec. 3405) The TSA shall:</p> <UL> <LI>revise certain regulations to enhance the eligibility requirements and disqualifying criminal offenses for individuals seeking or having unescorted access to an airport's SIDA; and <LI>propose disqualification if the individual was convicted, or found not guilty by reason of insanity, of a disqualifying criminal offense within 15 years before the date of an individual's application, or if the individual was incarcerated for that crime and released within 5 years before that date. </LI> </UL> <p>The TSA shall ensure the existence or development of a waiver process for approving the issuance of credentials for unescorted access to a SIDA for an individual found to be otherwise ineligible for such credentials, but about whom circumstances permit the conclusion the individual poses no terrorism risk or any other risk to aviation security warranting denial of the credential.</p> <p>Both the TSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shall implement fully the FBI's Rap Back service for recurrent criminal history vetting of eligible TSA-regulated populations of individuals with unescorted access to an airport SIDA. (The FBI Rap Back Service notifies authorized agencies of criminal, and, in limited cases, civil activity of individuals that occurs after the initial processing and retention of criminal or civil transactions.)</p> <p>The TSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall ensure that the TSA may receive automated, real-time access to additional Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) data and any other terrorism related category codes to improve the TSA credential vetting program.</p> <p>DHS shall authorize direct access for each airport operator to the E-Verify program and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) automated system to determine the eligibility of individuals seeking unescorted access to an airport SIDA.</p> <p>(Sec. 3406) The TSA shall develop performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security for airport SIDAs.</p> <p>(Sec. 3407) The TSA shall also:</p> <UL> <LI>develop a model and best practices for unescorted access security meeting specified criteria, <LI>expand the use of TSA officers and inspectors to conduct physical inspections of airport workers in each airport SIDA and at each SIDA access point, and <LI>review airports that have implemented additional airport worker screening or perimeter security. </LI> </UL> <p>The TSA may conduct a pilot program to test and validate best practices for comprehensive airport worker screening or perimeter security.</p> <p>(Sec. 3408) The TSA shall:</p> <UL> <LI>increase the use of red-team, covert testing of access controls to any secure airport areas; and <LI>review for continued relevancy and appropriate updating, consolidation, or revocation of every current security directive addressed to any regulated entity. </LI> </UL> <p>(Sec. 3410) The GAO shall assess TSA progress in implementing the requirements of this bill and their effect on aviation security.</p> <p>(Sec. 3411) A member of the Aviation Stakeholder Advisory Committee may continue to serve beyond the expiration of his or her term until the TSA appoints a successor.</p> <p>Subtitle E--Checkpoints of the Future </p> <p>(Sec. 3501) The TSA shall request the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to develop recommendations for more efficient and effective passenger screening processes. The Committee shall consider the following:</p> <UL> <LI>the configuration of a checkpoint; <LI>technology innovation; <LI>ways to address any vulnerabilities identified in audits of checkpoint operations; <LI>ways to prevent security breaches at airports at which federal security screening is provided; <LI>best practices in aviation security; <LI>recommendations from airport and aircraft operators, and from any relevant advisory committees; and <LI>"curb to curb" processes and procedures. </LI> </UL> <p>(Sec. 3502) The TSA shall establish a pilot program at three and not more than six category X airports to reconfigure and install security systems that increase efficiency and reduce vulnerabilities in airport terminals, particularly those that have large open areas where screening occurs.</p> <p>(Sec. 3503) The TSA shall also establish a pilot program at three airports to develop and test prototypes of screening security systems and security checkpoint configurations to expedite the movement of passengers by deploying an array of technologies including passive and active systems, new types of security baggage and passenger screening systems, and new systems to address passenger and baggage anomalies.</p> <p>(Sec. 3504) The TSA shall report to Congress on the pilot programs.</p> <p>(Sec. 3505) The TSA shall carry out the pilot programs using amounts:</p> <ul> <li>appropriated to it before enactment of this bill and available for obligation as of such enactment, and</li> <li>obtained as reimbursements from airports under such pilot programs. </li> </ul> <p>Subtitle F--Miscellaneous Provisions</p> <p>(Sec. 3601) The bill amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to require Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams to conduct security operations:</p> <ul> <li>in the sterile areas and other areas of airports where credentialed individuals have unescorted access, and </li> <li>in nonsterile areas.</li> </ul> <p>The bill reauthorizes the VIPR program, including funds to develop not more than 60 VIPR teams, for FY2016-FY2018. (Authorization for the VIPR program expired after FY2011.) </p> <p>(Sec. 3602) The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct DHS to ensure that certain terrorism prevention grant funds to state, local, and tribal governments are used for:</p> <ul> <li> training exercises to enhance preparedness for and response to mass casualty and active shooter incidents and security events at public locations, including airports and mass transit systems;and</li> <li>enhancing the security and preparedness of secure and nonsecure areas of airports and surface transportation systems.</li> </ul>]]></text>

        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require that the bill be reported back to the House forthwith with an amendment to extend the tax provisions in the underlying bill for one year in order for comprehensive tax reform to address these provisions. It also would prevent these three temporary tax provisions from permanently adding to the deficit, as opposed to the permanent extension in the underlying legislation that costs $79.2 billion and puts further pressure on the United States domestic discretionary priorities, pending reservation of a point of order. Subsequently, the reservation of a point of order was withdrawn.</text>
