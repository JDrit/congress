  <summary date="2016-04-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Jessie's Law

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit disclosure of patient records relating to substance abuse with the patient's oral consent or the consent of the patient's parent, legal guardian, or spouse. (Currently, disclosure is permitted only with the patient's written consent.)

Interchange of such records is permitted within accountable care organizations, health information exchanges, and integrated care arrangements for purposes of attaining interoperability, improving care coordination, reducing health care costs, and securing or providing patient safety.

The Department of Health and Human Services must develop and disseminate standards for hospitals and physicians regarding displaying a patient's history of opioid addiction in the patient's medical records with the patient's consent.</summary>
