(Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to work with a consortium, including the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, to support efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents, including threats or acts of terrorism.

Such a consortium must be composed primarily of nonprofit entities, including academic institutions, that develop, update, and deliver cybersecurity training in support of homeland security.

DHS may work with such a consortium to assist its national cybersecurity and communications integration center to:

 provide training to state and local first responders and officials, develop curriculums, and provide technical assistance; conduct cross-sector cybersecurity training and simulation exercises, including for state and local governments, critical infrastructure owners and operators, and private industry; help states and communities develop cybersecurity information sharing programs; and help incorporate cybersecurity risk and incident prevention and response into existing state and local emergency plans and continuity of operations plans. In selecting a consortium, DHS must consider: (1) any prior experience conducting cybersecurity training and exercises for state and local entities, and (2) the geographic diversity of its members to cover different regions across the United States.

DHS must conduct outreach to universities and colleges regarding opportunities to support efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents.

DHS's authority to carry out this bill terminates five years after its enactment.</summary>
