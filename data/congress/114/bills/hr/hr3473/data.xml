  <summary date="2015-09-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Local Farm Vehicle Flexibility Act

This bill prohibits the Department of Transportation from terminating, reducing, limitoing, or otherwise interfering with the amount or timing of grants a state is otherwise eligible to receive as a result of any minimum standard or exemption the state gives a covered farm vehicle or the driver of such vehicle less stringent than federal requirements for commercial motor vehicles and drivers.

A covered farm vehicle means any motor vehicle meeting certain gross weight requirements and:

 registered or otherwise designated by a state for use in, or transportation activities related to, the operation of farms; operated by a farm or ranch owner or operator, or an employee or family member; transporting to or from a farm or ranch agricultural commodities, livestock, agricultural supplies, or machinery; and not used in the operations of a for-hire motor carrier, nor transporting materials requiring a placard. A covered farm vehicle may also be one meeting these requirements but operated pursuant to a crop share farm lease agreement, owned by a tenant under that agreement, and transporting the landlord's portion of the crops.</summary>
