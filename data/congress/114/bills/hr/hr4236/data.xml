  <summary date="2015-12-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Financial Security Credit Act of 2015

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income-based tax credit equal to the lesser of $500 or 50% of the total amount deposited or contributed into designated savings products in a taxable year (financial security credit). A "designated savings product" is a qualified retirement plan, a qualified tuition plan, a Coverdell education savings account, a U.S. savings bond, a certificate of deposit with a duration of at least eight months, a savings account, or other savings product considered appropriate by the&#160;Department&#160;of the Treasury.

The Internal Revenue Service must notify individual taxpayers who may qualify for a financial security credit that they have the option of an electronic direct deposit if they deposit any portion of their tax refund into a designated savings product.</summary>
