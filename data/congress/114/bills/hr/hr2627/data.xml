This bill amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish and implement a plan, including through a five-year program of competitive grants, to promote the use of salad bars in schools participating in the school lunch program.

Priority in the award of grants may be given to entities that: (1) serve schools in which at least 50% of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches or that are located in food deserts, or (2) provide nutrition education. (A food desert is an area without ready access to fresh, healthful, and affordable food.)

USDA shall revise the March 27, 2013, policy memorandum SP 31-2013, "Salad Bars in the National School Lunch Program," in light of recommendations submitted to Congress under this Act.</summary>
