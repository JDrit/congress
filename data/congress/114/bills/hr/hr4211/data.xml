This bill amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act to authorize the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs) to use credit scores in purchasing residential mortgages only under certain conditions, including that the GSE has established and made publicly available a description of the process it will use to validate and approve credit scoring models.

The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency may, by regulation, establish standards and criteria for any process used by a GSE to validate and approve credit scoring models pursuant to the Acts.</summary>
