This bill requires the Department of Labor to administer summer and year-round youth employment programs that: (1)&#160;match youth participants with appropriate employers for high-quality employment opportunities; (2) subsidize participants' wages;&#160;(3) provide specified coaching and mentoring; (4) provide participants with supportive services to enable program participation, if applicable; (5) develop plans to increase unsubsidized employment opportunities; and (6) connect participants with literacy services.

In addition, Labor&#160;shall award competitive grants to assist community partnerships in improving high school graduation and youth employment rates. Grantees shall use funds to: (1) make appropriate use of existing data collection systems to target youths; (2) develop comprehensive pathways to higher education and employment; (3) provide comprehensive support systems; and (4) provide comprehensive systems aimed at preventing&#160;youths from disconnecting from education, training, and employment.

The bill establishes labor standards, performance accountability measures, and reporting requirements with respect to each of these new programs.</summary>
