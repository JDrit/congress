  <summary date="2016-11-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill revises the term "urbanized area" with respect to public transportation improvement projects to also treat areas as an urbanized area if the Department of Commerce determines that:

 the area was designated in a previous decennial census as an urbanized area, the area was not designated in the most recent decennial census as an urbanized area as the result of a natural disaster that caused the area's population to fall below 50,000 people, and the most recent annual estimate of the Bureau of the Census estimates the area's population to be restored to 50,000 or more people.</summary>
