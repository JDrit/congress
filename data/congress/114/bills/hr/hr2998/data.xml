This bill authorizes an independent insurance claims adjuster to apply to the National Association of Agents and Brokers for Membership for the purpose of licensure in any state that requires a license for such adjusters that is not among such states that have enacted, within four years of this Act's enactment: (1) uniform laws and regulations governing the licensure of individuals and entities authorized to adjust claims within the state, and (2) reciprocity laws and regulations governing the licensure of nonresident individuals and entities authorized to adjust such claims within those states.

The Department of the Treasury must annually determine a state's continued compliance with such requirements.</summary>
