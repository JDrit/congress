This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to exempt the construction of, impoundment of water in, and operation of the Lower Bois d'Arc Creek Reservoir Project by the North Texas Municipal Water District in Fannin County, Texas. Thus, the district would not need to obtain a permit for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters of the United States with respect to the construction of the dam, the flooding of the area for the reservoir, and the operation of that reservoir project, including any associated water transmission facilities.</summary>
