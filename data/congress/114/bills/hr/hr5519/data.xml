 This bill amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to entitle an eligible employee to leave to care for a domestic partner or his or her child, parent-in-law, adult child, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, or any other person related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship, if that person has a serious health condition.

This bill applies the same leave allowance to federal employees.</summary>
