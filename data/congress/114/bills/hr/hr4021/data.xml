This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to modify grant funding related to education technology and innovation.

The Department of Education shall award matching grants to states to strengthen state and local technological infrastructure and professional learning that supports digital learning.

Grant funds are allocated among states in proportion to each state's share of school improvement funds under the ESEA.

States must use at least 90% of their grant funds to award subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs), which shall use: (1) at least 40% of those funds to support the acquisition of technology that addresses their technology infrastructure and access needs; and (2) at least 40% of those funds to provide digital age professional learning opportunities for teachers, principals, school leaders, paraprofessionals, library and media personnel, specialized instructional support personnel, technology coordinators, and administrators.

To carry out grant and subgrant activities, including the purchase of technology, states may form purchasing consortia with other states, and LEAs may form purchasing consortia with other LEAs.</summary>
