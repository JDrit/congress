Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to make publicly available on the College Navigator website the employment information that schools who are participating in that Act's title IV (Student Assistance) programs are required to provide to prospective and enrolled students.

Requires those schools to supplement that employment information by indicating whether or not the jobs their graduates obtain are paid jobs or require any postsecondary education.

Requires those schools to include on their websites, and the Secretary to include on the College Navigator website, a link to the appropriate section of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website that provides information from the Occupational Employment Statistics program and the Occupational Outlook Handbook of the BLS.</summary>
