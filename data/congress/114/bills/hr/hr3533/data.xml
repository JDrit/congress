  <summary date="2015-09-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Water System Cost Savings Act

This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture to: (1) update their programs that provide drinking water technical assistance by including information on cost-effective, innovative, and alternative drinking water delivery systems; and (2) disseminate information on the cost effectiveness of alternative drinking water delivery systems, including wells and well systems, to communities and nonprofit organizations seeking federal funding for drinking water systems serving 500 or fewer persons.

In applications for a grant or loan from the federal government or a state that is using federal assistance for those drinking water systems, applicants must self-certify that they have considered as an alternative drinking water supply, drinking water delivery systems sourced by publicly owned individual, shared, and community wells.</summary>
