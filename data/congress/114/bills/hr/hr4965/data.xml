This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by requiring a manufacturer of a medical device to give the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) premarket notification of changes to the design or reprocessing instructions of its device.

Medical device manufacturers must also notify the FDA within five days of widely disseminating to health care providers in a foreign country communications relating to a change to the recommended reprocessing protocols, if any, for their device, or a safety concern about the device.

The bill bans the devices if the manufacturers violate the notification requirements concerning those design or reprocessing changes or communications to foreign health care providers.

The FDA must publish a list of the types of rapid assessment tests of reusable devices for which premarket notification must include proposed labeling, including validated instructions regarding sanitizing reusable devices.</summary>
