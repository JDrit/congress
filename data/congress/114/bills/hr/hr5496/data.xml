  <summary date="2016-06-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Family and Medical Leave Act Protections for Part-time Workers Act of 2016

This bill amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to make an employee eligible for coverage if that employee has been employed for at least 12 months by a covered employer from whom the leave is requested.

The bill repeals the current requirement that the employee have served at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period before the leave request.</summary>
