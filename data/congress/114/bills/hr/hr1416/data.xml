This bill requires any new presidential sequestration order for FY2016-FY2017 to declare that no reduction shall be made with respect to payments for physician-administered drugs and biologicals under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to the extent that such payments are made based on their average sales price.

The Government Accountability Office must examine the shift of cancer care from physician-run community cancer clinics to hospitals and its consequences to costs to the federal government and to Medicare beneficiaries for cancer care under the Medicare program.</summary>
