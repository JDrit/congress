  <summary date="2016-04-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Directed Energy Weapon Systems Acquisition Act of 2016

This bill amends the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 to state that, if supplies or support services are urgently needed to eliminate a deficiency in directed energy weapon systems, the Department of Defense (DOD) may use specified rapid acquisition procedures to acquire and deploy needed offensive or defensive directed energy weapon systems capabilities, supplies, and associated support services.

"Directed energy weapon system" means military action using highly focused sound, electromagnetic, or particle-beam energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, or personnel.

The bill redesignates DOD's High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office as the Joint Directed Energy Program Office.

The Office shall: (1) develop a strategic plan for development and transition of directed energy weapons capabilities, and (2) use new and revised DOD policies to accelerate the development and transition of directed energy capabilities toward fielding.</summary>
