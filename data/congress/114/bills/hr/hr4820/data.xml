(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to incorporate the public statements of former violent extremists or their associates into its efforts to combat terrorist recruitment, including efforts to counter-message foreign terrorist organization communications and related community engagement and public education efforts.

Additionally, DHS must coordinate with federal agencies and, as appropriate, engage nongovernmental and international partners in the identification and use of such public statements.

It declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to require DHS to collect statements directly from former violent extremists or their associates.</summary>
