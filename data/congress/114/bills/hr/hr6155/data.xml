This bill amends the Wilderness Act to prohibit the Department of Agriculture (for wilderness areas under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service) and the Department of the Interior (for wilderness areas under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management) from adopting, amending, or enforcing, any regulations, policies, or guidance that would delay federal, state, or local emergency response personnel from entering into a wilderness area or wilderness study area to respond to an emergency.

Any entrance by federal, state, or local emergency response personnel into a wilderness area or wilderness study area in response to an emergency shall be reported to the appropriate Department within 24 hours of the time at which such personnel first entered such area.</summary>
