Preventing Terrorists From Obtaining Firearms Act of 2015

This bill amends the federal criminal code to require the Department of Justice (DOJ), after receiving notice of a request to transfer a firearm to a known or suspected terrorist, to: (1) confirm the identity of the prospective transferee and confirm or rule out a connection to terrorism, (2) notify relevant law enforcement or intelligence agencies, and (3) determine whether the prospective transferee is the subject of an ongoing terrorism investigation.

It authorizes DOJ or a U.S. Attorney's Office to delay for up to 72 hours and file an emergency petition to prohibit the firearm transfer.

Preventing Terrorists From Obtaining Explosives Act of 2015

If DOJ receives an application for an explosives permit or license from a known or suspected terrorist, it must: (1) confirm the identity of the applicant and confirm or rule out a connection to terrorism, (2) notify relevant law enforcement or intelligence agencies, and (3) determine whether the applicant is the subject of an ongoing terrorism investigation.

It authorizes DOJ or a U.S. Attorney's Office to delay for up to 90 days and file an emergency petition to prohibit the approval of the application.

The bill requires DOJ to review the terrorist watch and no-fly lists and remove the name of any person whose name was erroneously placed on such lists.</summary>
