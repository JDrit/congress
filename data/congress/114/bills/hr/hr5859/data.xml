Community Counterterrorism Preparedness Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to carry out a grant program for emergency response providers to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the most likely terrorist attack scenarios, including active shooters against major metropolitan areas.

DHS shall provide to eligible applicants: (1) unclassified information on such scenarios, and (2) information on training and exercises best practices. Recipients may use grants to conduct training and exercises consistent with preventing, preparing for, and responding to such scenarios.

Emergency response providers in jurisdictions that are currently receiving, or that previously received, funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative may apply for such a grant.

Eligible applicants receiving funding under the program may include in funded activities neighboring jurisdictions that would be likely to provide mutual aid in response to terrorist attack scenarios.

Grant applications must include a description of how the applicant will work with community partners such as schools, places of worship, and businesses when conducting permitted activities.

DHS shall make funds provided under this bill available for use by a grant recipient for a period of at least 24 months.</summary>
