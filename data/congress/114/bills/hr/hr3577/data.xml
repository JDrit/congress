This bill requires the Government Publishing Office (GPO) to make any document of the House of Representatives or Senate available only in an electronic format accessible through the Internet, and prohibits printing or distribution of a printed copy.

 Upon the request of any person to whom GPO would have been required to provide a printed copy before this requirement, GPO may print and distribute it for the person's use, except that:

 the number of printed copies may not exceed the number GPO would have provided had this requirement not been in effect; and GPO may print and distribute copies to the person only upon payment of printing and distributing costs. Any Member of Congress office shall be exempt from these requirements.

Members and committees providing documents in electronic format are deemed to have met requirements of House and Senate rules and regulations with respect to distribution of printed copies of any document (including bills or resolutions).</summary>
