  <summary date="2016-09-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016

This bill prohibits federal agencies from authorizing a prescribed burn (i.e., a planned fire intentionally ignited) on federal land if, for the county or contiguous county in which such land is located, the national fire danger rating system is indicating an extreme fire danger level.

Nonetheless, a federal agency may authorize a prescribed burn under such a condition if it coordinates with the applicable state government and local fire officials.

If a federal agency authorizes a prescribed burn, the United States shall be liable for any damages to private properties caused by the burn.

If the United States is liable for any such damages, it shall pay them within 120 days of receipt of a substantiated claim.</summary>
