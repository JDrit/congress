 Requires the Office of Personnel Management to develop a separate and distinct wildland firefighter occupational series that more accurately reflects the variety of duties performed by such firefighters. Defines a "wildland firefighter" as a federal land management agency employee whose duties are primarily to perform work directly related to the prevention, control, suppression, and management of wildfires.</summary>
