This list shall also be provided to each federal agency for review and for making recommendations for collocations. </p> <p>The bill establishes a Federal Real Property Council, to be chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to: (1) develop guidance and ensure implementation of an efficient and effective real property management strategy, (2) identify opportunities for the federal government to better manage its property and assets, and (3) reduce the costs of managing federal properties. </p> <p>The council must update annually a real property management plan template with government-wide performance measures to reduce surplus property or achieve better utilization of underutilized property. The evaluation criteria must: (1) enable Congress and federal agencies to track their progress on a government-wide basis, and (2) allow for comparison of the performance of federal agencies against industry and other public sector agencies.</p> <p>The council must: (1) develop utilization rates consistent throughout each category of space and consistent with nongovernmental space use rates, (2) develop a strategy to reduce the reliance of federal agencies on leased space for long-term needs if ownership would be less costly, (3) provide guidance on eliminating inefficiencies in the federal leasing process, (4) compile a list of field offices suitable for collocation, and (5) develop guidelines for the use of public-private partnerships in the management of federal property.</p> <p>For five years, the council must report annually to the OMB on: (1) a list of the remaining excess property that is real property, surplus property that is real property, and underutilized property of each federal agency; (2) the council's progress in developing guidelines for agencies to assess their properties; (3) the progress of agencies in reducing excess and underutilized real property; (4) legislative recommendations; and (5) a list of entities that are consulted.</p> <p>The council must consult with: (1) state, local, and tribal authorities and other affected communities; and (2) private sector and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in transportation, commercial real estate, historic preservation, and homeless housing.</p> <p>The council must annually provide the real property management plan template and required reports to specified congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office.</p> <p>Federal agencies with independent leasing authority shall annually submit to the council a list of all leases currently in effect.
