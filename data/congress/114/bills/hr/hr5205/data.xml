  <summary date="2016-05-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2016

This bill requires cleaning products to bear a label with, and requires manufacturers to include on their websites, a list of all of the product's ingredients (including individual ingredients in dyes, fragrances, and preservatives) in descending order of predominance by weight, except that ingredients that constitute less than 1% of the product can be listed at the end in any order. Product websites must include: (1) the CAS Registry Number of each ingredient, and (2) an explanation of each ingredient's purpose.

A product that is not in conformity with the labeling and website listing requirements shall be treated as a misbranded hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.

A person may petition the Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate claims that a product does not satisfy these requirements.</summary>
