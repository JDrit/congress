  <summary date="2015-12-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to reimburse producers on farms for losses that are due to the inability to plant, grow, or ship a crop to market due to a federal or state government quarantine to control the Oriental fruit fly.

The payments are limited to 70% of the market value of the affected crop and end as soon as possible once the producer is able to resume marketing a crop after the quarantine is lifted.

In implementing this bill, USDA must not discriminate against or penalize a producer that obtained, or did not obtain, crop insurance, noninsured crop disaster assistance, or similar risk protection for the same type of crop, except that assistance provided by this bill must be reduced by the amount of assistance provided for the same losses under any other federal law.

Producers receiving assistance under this bill must agree to obtain crop insurance, noninsured crop disaster assistance, or similar risk protection for the same type of crop for at least the next two crop years, if the insurance, assistance, or protection is available.</summary>
