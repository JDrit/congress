This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to:

 modify the Federal Pell Grant program to increase the maximum award and restore year-round grants, make graduate and professional students eligible to receive subsidized Stafford Loans under the Federal Direct Loan program, direct the Department of Education to refinance outstanding federal student loans for Direct Loan and Federal Family Education Loan program borrowers, include a part-time job as a faculty member within the definition of "public service job" for purposes of the public service loan forgiveness program, and establish additional terms and conditions applicable to the income-based and income-contingent repayment plans. Additionally, the bill amends the federal bankruptcy code to permit a borrower to discharge in bankruptcy a nonprofit, government, or private student loan, or an obligation to repay an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend.</summary>
