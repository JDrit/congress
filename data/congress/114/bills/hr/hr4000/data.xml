  <summary date="2015-11-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard Deadline Harmonization Act of 2015

This bill delays the implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2015 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone issued under the Clean Air Act.

 Each state must designate all of its areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable with respect to the 2015 ozone standards by October 26, 2024. The EPA must promulgate final designations for those areas by October 26, 2025. States must submit a state implementation plan for the 2015 ozone standards by October 26, 2026.

The 2015 ozone standards do not apply to the review and disposition of an application for a preconstruction permit for the construction or modification of a major emitting facility or major stationary source if: (1) the application is completed before final designations under the Clean Air Act, or (2) the applicable permitting authority publishes a public notice of a preliminary determination or draft permit for the application before a certain date.

The bill changes the interval by which the EPA must review its NAAQS for criteria pollutants from a 5-year review cycle to a 10-year review cycle. The EPA must not complete any review of ozone criteria or its ozone NAAQS before October 26, 2025, or propose any revisions to them.</summary>
