Low-Dose Radiation Research Act of 2015

Requires the Director of the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science to carry out a research program on low dose radiation to enhance the scientific understanding of and reduce uncertainties associated with the effects of exposure to low dose radiation.

Requires the Director to enter into an agreement with the National Academies to conduct a study assessing the current status and development of a long-term strategy for low dose radiation research.

Requires such study to:

 identify current scientific challenges for understanding the long-term effects of ionizing radiation, assess the status of current low dose radiation research, formulate overall scientific goals for the future of low-dose radiation research, recommend a long-term strategic and prioritized research agenda to address scientific research goals for overcoming the identified scientific challenges in coordination with other research efforts, define the essential components of a research program that would address this research agenda within the universities and the National Laboratories, and assess the effectiveness of such a program. Directs the Secretary of Energy to deliver to Congress a five-year research plan that responds to the study's findings and recommendations and identifies and prioritizes research needs.

Makes DOE's limitation on human research inapplicable to research under this Act.</summary>
