  <summary date="2015-11-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Syrian Refugee Verification and Safety Act

This bill declares that: (1) no alien who is a refugee because of the conflict in Syria (covered alien) may be admitted to the United States as a refugee, (2) no funds may be expended to process refugee applications for covered aliens, and (3) no funds may be expended by the Department of State or the Department of Health and Human Services to resettle covered aliens in the United States.

These restrictions shall remain in effect until 30 days after the President certifies to Congress regarding:

 protocols and interagency coordination to adjudicate such U.S. admissions and resettlement; evaluation and review of such protocols and coordination by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community; State Department submission to Congress of an updated Congressional Presentation Document of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration for Fiscal Year 2016 that reflects security or other risks posed by covered aliens; and a State Department briefing to Congress on the increase in covered aliens seeking refugee admission and so admitted, including information on any terrorist conduct. This certification: (1) may not be submitted to Congress before 270 days, and (2) shall not have any effect if Congress enacts into law a joint resolution of disapproval within 15 days.</summary>
