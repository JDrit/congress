  <summary date="2016-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Protect Our Southwestern States Enforcement Act or the POSSE Act

This bill requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to: (1) ensure that specified Border Patrol sectors in Texas, California, and Arizona are fully staffed, including by hiring additional CBP and Border Patrol personnel as needed; and (2) maintain the number of Border Patrol stations in each such sector at current levels.

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to direct the Department of Homeland Security to construct double-layered fencing along the entire southwest border by December 31, 2019. (Current law provides for reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of such border.)</summary>
