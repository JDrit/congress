This bill amends the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 with respect to federal regulations governing the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in target housing that is offered for sale or lease.

A civil liability shall be imposed upon any violators of these regulations who fail to disclose lead-based paint hazards to residents or invitees of the target housing suffering damages from them.

Authority is granted to:

 the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate, administer oaths, and subpoena the production of documents, and the attendance and testimony of witnesses, in order to implement lead disclosure requirements; and any U.S. district court within the jurisdiction of a noncompliance inquiry to enforce such requirements.</summary>
