  <summary date="2016-07-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to eliminate the requirement for up to three months of retroactive coverage under Medicaid.

Under current law, a state&#160;Medicaid program&#160;must provide coverage for up to three months prior to an individual's application for benefits if the individual would have been eligible for benefits during that period. The bill eliminates this requirement and instead specifies that coverage begins&#160;in the month&#160;during which the individual applies for benefits.</summary>
