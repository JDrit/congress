 This bill makes it an unlawful employment practice for certain employers to seek information concerning a job applicant's salary history.

 An exception is established authorizing an employer to seek such information in a case in which the employer has made an offer of employment, including the compensation amount, to the applicant and the applicant volunteers such information and provides written authorization to the employer authorizing the employer to verify such information

 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue rules relating to such exception.

 Enforcement procedures and remedies are set forth under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, and the rights and protections extended to presidential offices.</summary>
