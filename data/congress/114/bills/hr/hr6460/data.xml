  <summary date="2016-12-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Buy America for Drinking Water Extension Act of 2016

This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring projects funded by the drinking water state revolving fund to only use iron and steel produced in the United States, unless: (1) it would be inconsistent with the public interest, (2) iron and steel products are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality, or (3) inclusion of iron and steel products produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25%.

The requirement does not apply with respect to a project if a state approves the plans and specifications for the project prior to October 1, 2018.</summary>
