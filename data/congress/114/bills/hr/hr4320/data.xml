This bill amends the federal criminal code to require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to report certain information to state and local law enforcement authorities following a determination, by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, that a prospective firearm purchaser is a prohibited person (i.e., a person who is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm).

DOJ must report to Congress on the categories of prohibited persons who are most likely to engage in criminal activity.</summary>
