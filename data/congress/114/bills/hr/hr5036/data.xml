This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with respect to&#160;how a state that had an approved home- and community-based Medicaid waiver as of January 1, 2014,&#160;may treat&#160;spousal income and assets for purposes of determining an individual's&#160;financial eligibility for services under the waiver.

With respect to such a state that disregarded an individual's spousal income and assets for those purposes,&#160;specified provisions of current law shall not prohibit the state from continuing to do so.</summary>
