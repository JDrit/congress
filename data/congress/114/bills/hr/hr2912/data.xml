Centennial Monetary Commission Act of 2015

 (Sec. 3) This bill establishes the Centennial Monetary Commission to: (1) examine how U.S. monetary policy since the creation of the Federal Reserve Board in 1913 has affected the performance of the U.S. economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and financial stability over time; (2) evaluate various operational regimes under which the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee may conduct monetary policy in terms achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and employment and price stability over the long term; (3) evaluate the use of macro-prudential supervision and regulation and of the lender-of-last-resort function of the Board as tools of monetary policy in terms of achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and employment and price stability over the long term; and (4) recommend a course for U.S. monetary policy going forward.

The Commission shall submit to Congress and make publicly available, by December 1, 2016, a report containing a statement of its findings and conclusions.

(Sec. 8) The Commission shall terminate on June 1, 2017.</summary>
