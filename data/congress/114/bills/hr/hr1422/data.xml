  <summary date="2015-03-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Credit Union Residential Loan Parity Act

Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to revise the definition of "member business loan," which currently excludes an extension of credit fully secured by a lien on a 1- to 4-family dwelling that is a member's primary residence.

Removes the condition that the dwelling be a member's primary residence, and so denying eligibility for a member business loan to any requested extension of credit that would be fully secured by a lien on a 1- to 4-family dwelling, regardless of whether it is or is not the member's primary residence.

Declares that this Act does not preclude the National Credit Union Administration from treating an extension of credit fully secured by a lien on a 1- to 4-family dwelling that is not a member's primary residence as a member business loan for purposes other than certain member business loan limitation requirements under the Act.</summary>
