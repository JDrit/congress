  <summary date="2015-11-05T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumers Act of 2015

This bill amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) and XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to compute cost-of-living increases for Social Security and Medicare benefits using a new index in place of the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics must prepare and publish, for this purpose,&#160;a monthly CPI for Elderly Consumers that reflects changes over time to expenditures typical for individuals aged 62 and older.</summary>
