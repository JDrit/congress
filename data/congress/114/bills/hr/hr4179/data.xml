This bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to require online public inspection files that must be uploaded to the Internet by television broadcast stations, AM or FM radio broadcast stations, cable operators, direct broadcast satellite service providers, or satellite digital audio radio service providers to be made available to the public in a machine-readable format that supports automated searching, bulk downloading, aggregation, manipulation, and sorting.

Public inspection files include political files that contain records of requests to purchase broadcast time by or on behalf of candidates for public office or to communicate a message relating to a political matter of national importance.</summary>
