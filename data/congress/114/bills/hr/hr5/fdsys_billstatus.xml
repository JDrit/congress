        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Esty motion to recommit with instructions, pending reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment that would guarantee educational opportunities for children with disabilities by requiring that each state: (1) demonstrate their laws do not result in a lower standard of education than for those students without disabilities; (2) grant students with disabilities access to a regular secondary school diploma; (3) give parents the right to informed consent about their childs education; (4) cannot lower expectations or academic achievement for students with disabilities; or (5) give educational opportunities for any student, including those from racial and ethnic minorities. Additionally, the motion requires the Secretary of Education to regulate learning environments                in order to protect children with disabilitie s from abusive                seclusion and restraint practi ces.</text>

        <text>Rule provides for consideration of H.R. 529 and H.R. 5. Provides for one hour of debate, waives all points of order against consideration of the bills. Section 1 of the resolution provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered as adopted and the bill, as amended shall be considered read. The resolution provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Section 2 provides that no further consideration of H.R. 5 shall be in order except pursuant to a subsequent order of the House. Section 3 waives the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House with respect to any resolution reported through the legislative day of March 2, 2015, relating to a measure making continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. Section 4 provides that it shall be in order at any time through the calendar day of March 1, 2015, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV, relating to a measure making or continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.</text>

The resolution provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Section 2 provides that no further consideration of H.R. 5 shall be in order except pursuant to a subsequent order of the House.

        <description>Amendment sought to insert language authorizing funds for the Secretary of Education to provide grants for early-childhood education scholarships, professional development and licensing credentials, or increased compensation for educators who have attained specific qualifications. Amendment also sought to require each state that desires a grant to include a description of its comprehensive early childhood professional development system in its application, and grant recipients must maintain their fiscal effort for the activities supported by the grant funds for a fiscal year at levels equal to or greater than their fiscal effort for such activities during the preceding fiscal year.</description>

        <purpose>An amendment No. 37 printed in part B of House Report 114-29 to ensure that federal education dollars go toward their intended use for student benefit in the classroom by clarifying that funds received under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act shall not be diverted by the states to fill prior unfunded liability shortfalls in teacher pension programs. When a state receives funds under ESEA and distributes those funds to LEAs, the amendment prohibits the state from requiring LEAs to make a contribution to a pension program that is in excess of the "normal cost" of that teacher's participation in the pension program.</purpose>

        <purpose>An amendment numbered 9 printed in Part B of House Report 114-29 to restore the paraprofessional qualifications that are in place under current law, which helped stop school districts from hiring paraprofessionals with little experience in education and no professional training. Since all districts are in compliance, and have been since 2006, this amendment would present no new burden.</purpose>
