 This bill amends the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 to authorize and appropriate FY2017 funds to the Department of the Interior for: (1) grants to any local government of the United States that demonstrates financial strain due to demands on public services by significant immigration from the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau; and (2) aid in defraying costs incurred as a result of increased demands placed on health, educational, social, or public safety services, or infrastructure related to such services due to the residence of qualified nonimmigrants.

Interior shall provide for periodic enumerations of qualified nonimmigrants in the states and territories of the United States.

A "qualified nonimmigrant" is defined as a person admitted to the United States pursuant to: (1) section 141 of the Compact of Free Association set forth in title II of such Act, or (2) section 141 of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the government of Palau.</summary>
