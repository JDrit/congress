  <summary date="2016-02-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016

This bill amends the federal criminal code to require a defendant, as a mandatory condition of supervised release, to pay court-ordered restitution.

It amends the Justice for All Act of 2004, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004, and the Innocence Protection Act of 2004, to:

 reauthorize grants for victims assistance programs; reauthorize crime victims notification grants; give preference to Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program grant applicants that use funds for forensic nurse examiner programs in rural or underserved areas; reauthorize DNA research and development demonstration grants, DNA programs and activities at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and DNA technology grants to identify missing persons; reauthorize the Capital Litigation Improvement Grant Program; reauthorize the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program; and direct the National Institute of Justice to establish best practices for evidence retention. The Department of Justice must allocate specified funds for testing and auditing backlogged rape kits.

The bill amends the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 to:

 narrow the scope of grant program funds subject to a reduction for a state's failure to comply with national prison rape standards, revise and expand requirements with respect to adopting national prison rape standards, and require background checks for compliance auditors. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to revise and reauthorize the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program.

 Effective Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2015

This bill requires an application for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds to include a statewide strategic plan to improve the administration of criminal justice.</summary>
