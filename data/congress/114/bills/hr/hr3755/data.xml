  <summary date="2015-10-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise provisions related to graduate medical education (GME)&#160;residency positions&#160;and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Under current law, for purposes of calculating Medicare payments for hospitals, certain limitations apply regarding the total number of GME residency positions in a hospital's training program. The bill specifies that these limitations shall not apply to any residency position that counts towards meeting the VA's obligation under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to increase by 1,500 the number of GME residency positions at VA medical facilities.

The bill also extends by five years the period over which the VA must increase the number of&#160;GME residency positions at its medical facilities.</summary>
