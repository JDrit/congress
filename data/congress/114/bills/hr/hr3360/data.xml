This bill directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)&#160;to provide individuals who have been affected by a breach of personnel records in a database network maintained by the Department of the Interior&#160;or OPM with complimentary identity protection coverage that: (1) is not less comprehensive than the complimentary identity protection&#160;coverage provided before the enactment date of this Act, (2) is effective for a period of not less than 10 years, and (3) includes not less than $5 million in identity theft insurance.

The bill requires OPM to: (1)&#160;issue regulations to ensure that affected individuals whose credit scores have been negatively impacted by a&#160;data breach&#160;are not disqualified from access to classified information solely on the basis of a compromised credit score, and (2) establish a task force to develop specific&#160;recommendations on mitigating adverse consequences relating to&#160;data breaches.</summary>
