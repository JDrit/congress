This bill amends the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to authorize the Secretary of the Army to accept and expend funds contributed by a private entity to expedite the evaluation of a permit of that entity related to a project or activity for a public purpose under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army.

A "private entity" includes a business association, a cooperative of businesses, associations, or individuals.

Such authority expires 10 years after enactment of this Act. The Government Accountability Office is required, within 7 years after enactment of this Act, to carry out a study of the implementation of such authority.</summary>
