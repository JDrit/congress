This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), at the request of an eligible veteran for whom the VA is required to provide domiciliary, nursing home, adult day health, or hospital care, or who is determined to be in need of such care, to place the veteran (at the expense of the United States) in a state licensed or certified residential care facility that meets VA standards if the cost of providing such care through the facility is less than the cost of providing the care through any other available option.

An eligible veteran is a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 70% or more disabling.</summary>
