  <summary date="2016-03-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) to every state that expands Medicaid&#160;coverage for&#160;individuals who are newly eligible under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, regardless of when&#160;such expansion takes place.

Under current law, the enhanced FMAP is equivalent to 100% in 2014 through 2016, 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% thereafter. The bill retains this enhanced FMAP, but bases it on a term of years rather than on specific dates.

The bill applies retroactively.</summary>
