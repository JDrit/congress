This bill amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt qualified 501(c)(3) bonds issued after the enactment of this bill on behalf of a historically black college or university from state and local taxes.

The bill also amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for jurisdictions that forgo taxes with respect to the interest payments under such a bond. The credit is equal to the total amount of interest paid on such a bond during the taxable year. The Department of the Treasury must pay the credit to the qualifying jurisdiction as soon as practicable after the recipient of the interest payments files a tax return with the jurisdiction.</summary>
