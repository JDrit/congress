This bill amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to permit an individual to provide to a creditor as proof of military service, in order to qualify for the active service interest rate limitation, a certified letter from a commanding officer or any other appropriate indicator of military service. A creditor may use information from the Defense Manpower Database Center indicating that the individual is on active duty.

A creditor that uses center information has not failed to treat the individual's debt as required if: (1) such information indicates that such individual is not on active duty; and (2) the creditor has not received the other proof required.</summary>
