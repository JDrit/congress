  <summary date="2016-05-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Preventing Tragedies Between Police and Communities Act of 2016

This bill requires a state or local government that receives funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to train law enforcement officers on de-escalation techniques. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may reduce by up to 20% the JAG allocation of a state or local government that fails to comply.

DOJ must collect data on the efforts of state and local governments to enhance de-escalation training for law enforcement officers.

Additionally, a state or local government that receives JAG program funding must enact a law, policy, or procedure that establishes an affirmative duty on a law enforcement officer to use de-escalation techniques. DOJ must reduce by 15% the JAG allocation of a state or local government that fails to enact such law, policy, or procedure.

 DOJ must issue guidance on compliance with these requirements.</summary>
