        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Torres motion to recommit with instructions pending a reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to add at the end of the bill a section pertaining to Report on Emergency Vehicle Response Times of Companies Owned by Private Funds. Subsequently, the reservation was removed.</text>
