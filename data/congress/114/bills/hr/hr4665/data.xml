Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Commerce to enter into a joint memorandum with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to conduct, acting through the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an assessment and analysis of the outdoor recreation economy of the United States and the effects attributable to it on the overall U.S. economy.

In conducting the assessment, Commerce: (1) may consider employment, sales, contributions to travel and tourism, and other appropriate contributing components of the outdoor recreation economy; and (2) must consult with specified federal agency heads and representatives of businesses, including small business concerns, that engage in commerce in the outdoor recreation economy.

No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this bill. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized.</summary>
