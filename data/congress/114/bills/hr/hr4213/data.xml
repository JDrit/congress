This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to make citizens of Puerto Rico eligible for the federal earned income tax credit and allow them to claim the refundable portion of the child tax credit on the same basis as U.S. taxpayers. In making the earned income tax credit applicable to Puerto Rican citizens, the bill modifies credit requirements to allow taxpayers in Puerto Rico to claim the credit at age 21 (rather than age 25) and to allow a credit percentage of 40, without regard to the number of qualifying children claimed by the taxpayer.</summary>
