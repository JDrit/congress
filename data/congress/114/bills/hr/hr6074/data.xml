This bill prohibits the Judgment Fund from being used to make payments for any claim pertaining to the risk corridor program established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (The Judgment Fund is a permanent and indefinite appropriation to pay judgments against the United States, including awards, compromise settlements, and related interest and costs. The risk corridor program is a mechanism that adjusts payments to health plans based on the ratio of the allowable costs of the plan to the plan's aggregate premiums.)</summary>
