  <summary date="2016-01-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Mentor-Protege Cooperation Reform Act of 2016

This bill amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 to revise the no-affiliation requirement in the eligibility criteria under the Mentor-Protege Program of the Department of Defense (DOD) for a mentor firm to receive the award of a federal contract and enter into an agreement with one or more protege firms to provide them certain assistance.

The bill establishes procedures for the Small Business Administration (SBA) or DOD to determine that no affiliation between mentor and protege exists.

The bill amends the Small Business Act to bar DOD from carrying out a Mentor-Protege Program for a small business unless: (1) it submits a plan to the SBA, and (2) the SBA approves that plan.</summary>
