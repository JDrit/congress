  <summary date="2016-02-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Employee Rights Act 

This bill repeals current authority allowing the deduction of labor organization dues from employee pay and prohibits federal agencies, including executive, legislative, and judicial agencies, the U.S. Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission, and the government of the District of Columbia, from deducting any amount from the pay of an employee for the dues of a labor organization.

The bill prohibits employee dues collected by a labor organization from being used for any purpose not directly related to the organization's collective bargaining activities without employee authorization.

The bill requires a vote of more than 50% of all employees (not just employees who cast ballots) to approve union representation and extends this requirement to postal service employees.

An employee may elect, in writing, to withhold personal information from a labor organization during organizing activity.

The bill requires that all elections relating to labor representation, including elections involving postal service employees, have secret paper ballots.</summary>
