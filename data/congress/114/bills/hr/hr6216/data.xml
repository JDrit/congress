This bill requires a state that receives funds under a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program for law enforcement activities to require state and local law enforcement agencies to submit investigation records pertaining to an individual's injury or death by a law enforcement officer or while in the custody of a law enforcement agency.

DOJ must reduce by 10% the allocation of grant funds for a state or local government that fails to comply.

The bill appropriates additional FY2017 funds for Community Oriented Policing Services grants to acquire body-worn cameras.</summary>
