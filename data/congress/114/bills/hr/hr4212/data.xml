This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program through which up to five eligible Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations shall provide home and community-based care to eligible Medicare beneficiaries. For purposes of the demonstration program, an eligible Medicare beneficiary is ineligible for Medicaid and unable to perform two or more activities of daily living.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) shall establish payment rates for eligible MA plans under the&#160;demonstration program. Such payment rates are capped but shall be in addition to payments otherwise made to MA organizations with respect to such plans.

CMS shall also: (1) help to educate eligible Medicare beneficiaries on the availability of the program, and (2) provide for program evaluation by an independent third party.</summary>
