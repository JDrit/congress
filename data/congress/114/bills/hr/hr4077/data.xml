  <summary date="2015-11-18T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Established Provider Act of 2015

This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a system for designating providers that represent a low risk of submitting fraudulent Medicare claims as "established providers" for purposes of applying for special treatment in the claim review process.

To qualify as an established provider, a provider must demonstrate that, within a specified timeframe: (1) at least 90% of Medicare claims submitted by the provider were determined to be eligible for full or partial payment, and (2) the provider appealed at least 90% of all Medicare claims&#160;that were not initially determined to be eligible for payment.

HHS may withhold payment for a Medicare claim made by an established provider&#160;only if a&#160;final determination has been made that the claim is ineligible for payment. If such a final determination is made, the provider shall repay such payment electronically and within a specified timeframe.</summary>
