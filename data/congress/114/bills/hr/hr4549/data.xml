(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to conduct, and provide all necessary staff and equipment for, security screening at any airport that lost commercial air service on or after January 1, 2013, if the airport operator submits: (1) a request for the TSA to conduct such screening, and (2) written confirmation of a commitment from a commercial air carrier that it intends to resume service at the airport within one year.

The TSA shall ensure that the process of implementing security screening at such an airport is complete by the later of: (1) 90 days after the operator of the airport submits a request, or (2) the date on which the carrier intends to resume service.

The TSA shall carry out this bill in a manner that does not negatively affect operations at airports not described in this bill that are otherwise provided security screening conducted by the TSA.</summary>
