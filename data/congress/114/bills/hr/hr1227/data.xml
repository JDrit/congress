 Authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) to carry out a pilot program to enhance DOD's efforts to provide job placement assistance and related employment services to members of the National Guard and Reserves and veterans of the Armed Forces. Requires the program to follow a job placement program model that focuses on working one-on-one with a member of a reserve component to cost-effectively provide job placement services.

Requires DOD to: (1) develop outcome measurements to evaluate the success of the program, and (2) report to the congressional defense committees on program results.

Terminates the authority to carry out the program on September 30, 2018, with an authorized extension for up to two additional fiscal years.</summary>
