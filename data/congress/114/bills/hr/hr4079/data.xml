  <summary date="2015-11-19T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Secure Refugee Process Act of 2015

This bill declares that no alien shall be admitted as a refugee:

 whose identity has not been satisfactorily established pursuant to Department of Homeland Security procedures, which shall address any insufficient, conflicting, or unreliable information, including biographic and biometric data that is unresolved at the time of admission; and if, by the time of admission, the alien's identity has not been checked against specified federal records or databases to determine any national security, criminal, or other grounds on which the alien may be inadmissible. An alien may only be admitted as a refugee after DHS certifies that all provisions of this Act have been complied with and that the alien has not been firmly resettled in a safe third country.

DHS shall report to Congress monthly regarding the total number of refugee applicants of special interest and the number of such applicants whose applications were denied.

The Inspector General of DHS shall conduct an annual risk-based review of a sampling of certifications and report its findings to Congress.</summary>
