  <summary date="2015-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans Dignified Burial Act 

Directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): (1) upon confirming the veteran status of a deceased veteran in the custody of a local medical examiner, funeral director, county service group, or other similar entity, to request from that entity the specific date of the veteran's scheduled interment; and (2) during each 30-day period following the request to repeat it until the entity confirms the scheduled internment date or that the veteran has been interred.

Requires the VA, by March 1 of each year, to report to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees on unclaimed deceased veterans interred after the 30-day period following the initial VA request.</summary>
