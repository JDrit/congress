This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify the federal student aid eligibility requirements for students who are not high school graduates.

Currently, a student without a high school diploma or homeschool credential is eligible to receive federal student aid if such student is enrolled in a career pathway program and demonstrates an ability to benefit from an institution's education or training program.

This bill eliminates enrollment in a career pathway program as a federal student aid eligibility requirement. A student without a high school diploma or homeschool credential is eligible to receive federal student aid by demonstrating an ability to benefit from an institution's education or training program.</summary>
