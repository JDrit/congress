This bill amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to requirements the Department of State must meet to rescind any determination that the government of a foreign country:

 has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism; and for this reason may not receive assistance under the Act, the Food for Peace Act, the Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945. The State Department may rescind such a determination and waive the prohibition on assistance only if, in addition to other existing requirements for rescission and waiver, Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval according to a specified procedure.</summary>
