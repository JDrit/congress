  <summary date="2015-12-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the federal criminal code limit the civil liability of a defendant who misuses personal information in a driving record.

Current law establishes civil liability for a defendant who knowingly obtains, discloses, or uses personal information in a driving record for an unauthorized purpose.

This bill limits a defendant's civil liability to the knowing disclosure or use of a driver's personal information for an unauthorized purpose.

Additionally, it revises the liability standard for punitive damages to require proof that a defendant's conduct was intentional (instead of willful or reckless).</summary>
