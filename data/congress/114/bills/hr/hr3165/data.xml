This bill requires the District of Columbia, upon an individual's arrest, to give the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) information necessary to determine the individual's citizenship and immigration status, including name, aliases, and fingerprints.

Upon receiving this information DHS shall:

 issue a detainer requiring the District to detain the alien for up to 48 hours after the conclusion of any criminal or other legal proceeding under District law, or after completion of any term of imprisonment to which the alien may be sentenced under District law; and take the alien into custody upon release from District custody. Upon receipt of a DHS detainer the District shall hold an arrested alien for up to 48 hours: (1) following conclusion of the District's charging or dismissal proceeding, or (2) after the alien has completed the his or her sentence.

 If DHS fails to issue a detainer, no DHS political appointee may perform certain functions until the alien in question has been taken into custody.

Any District officer, acting in his or her official capacity, who knowingly violates the notification or detention requirements under this Act shall pay a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each such violation.</summary>
