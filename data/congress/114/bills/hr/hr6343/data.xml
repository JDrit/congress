  <summary date="2016-11-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Farmers Markets for Food Deserts Act of 2016 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income amounts received by the taxpayer from the sale of locally and regionally produced agricultural products to members of the general public at a fixed location (other than a retail store) in an underserved community. (Underserved communities are located in areas of concentrated poverty with limited access to fresh locally or regionally grown foods.)

The bill also amends the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 to specify that grants or other assistance provided under the Farmers' Market and Local Food Promotion Program may be used to pay any fees associated with obtaining a permit to sell locally and regionally produced agricultural products at a farmers' market located in an underserved community.</summary>
