  <summary date="2015-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Securing America's Next Generation of Safe Loggers and Truckers Act 

This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to make the restrictions on oppressive child labor inapplicable to employment of an employee age 16 or 17 exclusively by a parent, or a person standing in place of a parent, in a logging operation owned or operated by that parent or person.

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration shall establish a test program to allow states to enter into interstate compacts with contiguous states, approved by the governor of each state, to standardize the requirements for operators of commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce.

A commercial driver's license issued by one state participating in a compact shall be recognized as valid in every state participating in the compact.</summary>
