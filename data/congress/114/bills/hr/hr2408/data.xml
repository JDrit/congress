This bill establishes in the Administration for Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the Federal Interagency Working Group on Reducing Child Poverty.

The Working Group as its primary goal shall develop a national plan to reduce:

 within 10 years the number of children living in poverty in the United States to half the number cited in the report of the U.S. Census Bureau on Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2013; within the same 10 years the number of children living in extreme poverty in the United States to zero; and within 20 years the number of children living in poverty, extreme or otherwise, in the United States to zero. HHS shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for two public workshops to provide the Working Group with information to assist in the development of the plan.</summary>
