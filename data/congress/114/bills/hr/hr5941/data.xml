This bill prohibits an executive agency from transferring funds to a state sponsor of terrorism without prior written notice to Congress (with an exception for humanitarian assistance).

An intended transfer shall not take effect if Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the transfer.

An intended transfer shall not take effect until the latest of:

 the date occurring 60 days after Congress receives such written notice; in the case of a presidential veto of a joint resolution of disapproval, the earlier of the date on which either chamber fails to override the veto or the date occurring 30 session days after Congress received the veto; or the date the transfer otherwise would have taken effect (unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted). The bill provides a special rule for a written notice of transfer submitted within 60 legislative days before Congress adjourns.

The bill sets forth congressional procedures for such a joint resolution of disapproval.</summary>
