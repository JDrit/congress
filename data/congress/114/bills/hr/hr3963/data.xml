This bill permits a veteran who has a compensable disability attributable to an injury for which the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart to use commissary stores and MWR retail facilities on the same basis as a member of the Armed Forces entitled to retired or retainer pay.

A dependent of the veteran shall be permitted to use these facilities on the same basis as a dependent of a member of the Armed Forces entitled to retired or retainer pay.

"MWR retail facility" means exchange stores and other revenue-generating facilities operated by nonappropriated fund activities of the Department of Defense for the morale, welfare, and recreation of members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
