This bill amends the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Department of the Interior to participate in the design, planning, and construction of recycled water system facilities in California in cooperation with:

 the cities of Benicia, Brentwood, Ceres, Fresno, Hayward, Modesto, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Pleasanton, Redwood City, Sunnyvale, and Turlock; the Dublin San Ramon Services District; the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District; the Delta Diablo; the Ironhouse Sanitary District; the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency; the Del Puerto Water District; Stanislaus County; the Santa Clara Valley Water District; the San Jose Water Company; the West Bay Sanitary District; and the town of Yountville. The federal share of each project is limited to 25%.
