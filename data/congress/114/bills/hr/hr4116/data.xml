  <summary date="2015-11-19T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act with respect to the prohibition declaring that an insured depository institution that is not well-capitalized may not accept funds obtained, directly or indirectly, by or through any deposit broker for deposit into one or more deposit accounts.

Reciprocal deposits of an insured depository institution, however, shall not be considered to be prohibited broker deposits if:

 the composite condition of the institution at its most recent examination was adjudged either good or outstanding, or total reciprocal deposits of the institution do not exceed either $10 billion or 20% of its total liabilities.</summary>
