  <summary date="2015-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2015 

 This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require each covered program to prohibit child abuse and neglect and meet specified minimum standards.

A "covered program" is a facility of a program operated by a public or private entity that, with respect to one or more children who are unrelated to the program owner or operator, purports to provide treatment or modify behaviors in a residential environment.

HHS shall: (1) implement a review process for overseeing, investigating, and evaluating reports of child abuse and neglect; and (2) establish a process to assist states in the oversight and enforcement of this Act.

HHS must refer any violation of such standards to the Attorney General, who shall file a complaint on his or her own initiative regardless of whether such a referral has been made.

The bill amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to establish additional eligibility requirements for grants to states to prevent child abuse and neglect at residential programs. States receiving grants must develop policies and procedures to prevent child abuse and neglect at covered programs, including standards that meet or exceed the standards required under this Act.</summary>
