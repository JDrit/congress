  <summary date="2015-03-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medical Device Tax Elimination Act

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the excise tax on medical devices and offsets the cost of such repeal by: (1) eliminating the tax deduction for income attributable to oil, natural gas, or primary products thereof for major integrated oil companies (companies that have an average daily worldwide annual production of crude oil of at least 500,000 barrels and annual gross receipts in excess of $1 billion); (2) prohibiting the use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting method by major integrated oil companies; and (3) denying the foreign tax credit to major integrated oil companies that are dual taxpayers (companies that receive an economic benefit from a foreign country or a possession of the United States that does not impose a generally applicable income tax).</summary>
