This bill amends the National Housing Act to require that a Federal Housing Administration mortgage notice for a prospective borrower who is a veteran include, in addition to comparative rate and fee information about conventional loans, similar comparative information about Veterans Administration (VA) home loans.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency shall direct the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to revise the uniform residential loan application by December 31, 2017, to include: (1) a check box to indicate that the applicant is a veteran; (2) the statement "If you are a veteran, you may be eligible for a VA mortgage"; and (3) a blank line for the borrower to initial and a statement that all applicants must initial such blank line to confirm that they have read such VA mortgage eligibility statement.

The bill requires pre-separation counseling for a member of the Armed Forces who is separating from active duty to include:

 information on the availability of VA home loan services and housing assistance benefits, including the authority of a member to use an honorable discharge certificate as a certificate of eligibility for a VA guaranteed housing loan or to request a specific certificate of eligibility for such loan; and counseling on responsible borrowing practices.</summary>
