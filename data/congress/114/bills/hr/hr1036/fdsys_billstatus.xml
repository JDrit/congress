Requires the GSE to repay the loan in accordance with the amortization schedule established.</p> <p>Requires any dividends paid by the GSE to the Treasury under the Agreement before the modification to be treated as payments of principal and interest due under the loan, to be credited against payments due: (1) first to the loan with the earliest origination date that has not yet been fully repaid until it is repaid, and (2) then to the loan having the next earliest origination date until it is repaid.</p>]]></text>
