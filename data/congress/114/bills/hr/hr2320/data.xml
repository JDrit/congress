(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 to: (1) extend the availability of the Do Not Pay Initiative to the judicial and legislative branches and to the states; and (2) authorize the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance that establishes privacy requirements that shall be incorporated into Do Not Pay Initiative access agreements with states and the judicial and legislative branches.

(Sec. 3) The Departments of Defense and State must submit, promptly and on a regular basis, relevant information on the deaths of individuals.

The OMB, in consultation with the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, the heads of other relevant federal, state, and local agencies, and Indian tribes and tribal organizations, as appropriate, shall issue guidance regarding implementation of the Initiative to the Department of the Treasury and each agency or component of an agency: (1) that operates or maintains a database of death records maintained by the Social Security Administration; or (2) for which the OMB determines improved data matching would be relevant, necessary, or beneficial.

(Sec. 4) Treasury must report to Congress on:

 data analytics performed as part of the Do Not Pay Business Center operated by Treasury for the purpose of detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments through pre-award, post-award prepayment, and post-payment analysis; the metrics used in determining whether the analytic and investigatory efforts have reduced, or contributed to the reduction of, improper payments or improper awards; and the target dates for implementing the data analytics operations performed as part of the Do Not Pay Business Center.</summary>
