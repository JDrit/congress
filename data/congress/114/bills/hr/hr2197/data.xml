  <summary date="2015-05-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Youth Prison Reduction through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and Education Act or the Youth PROMISE Act

Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to establish a PROMISE Advisory Panel to assist the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in: (1) assessing and developing standards and evidence-based and promising&#160;practices to prevent juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity, and (2) collecting data in designated geographic areas to assess the needs and existing resources for juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity prevention and intervention.

Authorizes the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to award grants to local governments and Indian tribes to: (1) plan and assess evidence-based and promising practices for juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity prevention and intervention, especially for at-risk youth; and (2) implement PROMISE plans, developed by local PROMISE Coordinating Councils (PCCs), for coordinating and supporting the delivery of juvenile delinquency and gang prevention and intervention programs in local communities and Indian tribes.

Establishes a National Research Center for Proven Juvenile Justice Practices to provide PCCs and the public with&#160;research and other information about evidence-based practices related to juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang prevention or intervention.

Directs the Office to award grants to&#160;institutions of higher education to serve as regional research partners with PCCs that are located in the same geographic region as the educational institution.</summary>
