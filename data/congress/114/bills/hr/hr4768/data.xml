Separation of Powers Restoration Act of 2016

This bill modifies the scope of judicial review of agency actions to authorize courts reviewing agency actions to decide de novo (without giving deference to the agency's interpretation) all relevant questions of law, including the interpretation of: (1) constitutional and statutory provisions, and (2) rules made by agencies.

No law may exempt such a civil action from the application of the amendments made by this bill except by specific reference to these provisions.</summary>
