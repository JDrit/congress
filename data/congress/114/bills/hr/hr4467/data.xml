  <summary date="2016-02-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Marijuana Advertising in Legal States Act of 2016 or the MAILS Act

This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to modify the application of a provision that limits advertisements with respect to certain controlled substances.

Currently, it is a crime to knowingly place a written advertisement in a newspaper, magazine, handout, or other publication for the purpose of receiving, buying, or distributing a schedule 1 controlled substance (e.g., marijuana). This legislation declares that the prohibition does not apply with respect to an advertisement for a marijuana-related activity that complies with state law.</summary>
