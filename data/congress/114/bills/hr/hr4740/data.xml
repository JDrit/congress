  <summary date="2016-03-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cybercrime Enforcement Training Assistance Act of 2016

This bill directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to state and local governments to prevent, enforce, and prosecute cybercrimes against individuals. A cybercrime against an individual is a criminal offense that involves use of a computer, including a computer network or interactive electronic device, to harm an individual.

DOJ must also award a grant to a nonprofit private cybercrime organization to establish and maintain the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals. It must provide technical assistance and training resources, maintain a resource library, and conduct research to improve the capacity of governments, communities, and individuals to prevent, enforce, and prosecute cybercrimes against individuals.</summary>
