  <summary date="2016-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Great Lakes Pipeline Safety Act of 2016

This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a study to determine the economic and environmental risks of oil or hazardous liquids spills or leaks in the Straits of Mackinac that a failure of onshore, underwater pipeline facilities within the straits would pose to the Great Lakes.

In addition, DOT must evaluate the condition and structural integrity of the facilities.

DOT shall terminate operations of a facility upon a determination, based on such studies, that risk of hazard to life, property, or the environment warrants termination.</summary>
