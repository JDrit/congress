This bill authorizes the military department concerned to reimburse a member of the Armed Forces who is reassigned for a permanent change of station or assignment from one state to another for qualified relicensing costs of the member's spouse.

Reimbursement may not exceed $500 for each change of station or assignment.

The Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security (with respect to the Coast Guard) shall work with states to improve license portability.

"Qualified relicensing costs" are the costs, including exam and registration fees, needed to secure a license or certification to engage in the same profession in the new state.</summary>
