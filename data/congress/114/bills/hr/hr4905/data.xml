  <summary date="2016-04-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">ATF Enforcement Act

This bill amends the federal judicial code to require the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to be appointed by the Attorney General. Currently, the Director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

 Additionally, it amends several appropriations laws to remove limitations on the ATF's authority to conduct activities related to the administration of federal firearms laws.

The amended appropriations laws include:

 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016; the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013; the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012; the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010; the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009; the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008; the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006; the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005; and the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003. The bill removes provisions from these laws that:

 prohibit the consolidation or centralization within the Department of Justice of firearm transfer records maintained by federal firearms licensees; prohibit the imposition of a requirement that firearms dealers conduct a physical inventory; require instant background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours; limit the use of firearms tracing data; limit the processing of Freedom of Information Act requests in connection with arson or explosive incidents or firearm traces; limit denials of applications to import "curios or relics" firearms, parts, or ammunition; prohibit denials of federal firearms licenses due to lack of business activity; prohibit the transfer of functions, missions, or activities to other agencies or departments; prohibit the search of electronic firearm transfer records of federally licensed gun dealers who go out of business; and prohibit denials of applications to import certain non-sporting shotguns.</summary>
