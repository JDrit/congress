This bill directs the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce to assess the location of and services provided by U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) in relation to the location of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that export U.S. products and services in order to identify:

 those USEACs that should be closed or moved based on low productivity, and those locations where a USEAC should be located based on need. The ITA shall take necessary steps, through actions by the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service of the Department of Commerce, to increase exports by SMEs.</summary>
