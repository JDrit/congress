This bill directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) each year, for each public housing agency, to:

 monitor the extent of noncompliance with the community service and economic self-sufficiency requirements of the United States Housing Act of 1937, and determine the aggregate amount provided in federal subsidies for all public housing dwelling units that were occupied by noncompliant tenants. By September 30 of each fiscal year, HUD shall publish this amount in the Federal Register.

In each new fiscal year this amount, as determined and published for the preceding fiscal year, shall be rescinded from funds made available for the Management and Administration account of HUD.</summary>
