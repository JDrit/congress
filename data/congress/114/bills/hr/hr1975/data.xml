Securities and Exchange Commission Overpayment Credit Act 

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offset future fees and assessments otherwise due from a national securities exchange or national securities association if it is informed within 10 years that the entity has overpaid past fees and assessments.

This requirement applies to any fees and assessments paid before, on, or after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
