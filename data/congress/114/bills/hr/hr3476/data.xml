  <summary date="2015-09-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015 

This bill requires the congressional leadership of both parties to appoint an equal number of individuals to negotiate legislation to: (1) increase the security and nonsecurity discretionary spending limits equally for both FY2016 and FY2017, and (2) reduce the deficit by the amount deemed appropriate.

 If a majority of the appointees approve the measure, Congress must consider the legislation using expedited legislative procedures included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.

If the legislation is not enacted prior to October 1, 2015, the bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the discretionary spending limits by specified amounts and eliminate the automatic spending cuts required in FY2016 and FY2017 by sequestration under current law.</summary>
