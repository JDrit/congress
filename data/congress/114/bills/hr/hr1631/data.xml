This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise requirements for medical rehabilitation research.

The purpose of the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) is revised to include coordination of research and research training.

The NCMRR must develop and periodically update a comprehensive research plan for medical rehabilitation research. Currently, this research plan is developed and updated by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The NCMRR must: (1) annually report on progress in achieving the objectives, benchmarks, and guiding principles described in the research plan; and (2) develop guidelines governing the funding for medical rehabilitation research by the National Institutes of Health.

The Medical Rehabilitation Coordinating Committee must periodically host a scientific conference or workshop on medical rehabilitation research.

The Department of Health and Human Services must enter into interagency agreements to coordinate medical rehabilitation research.</summary>
