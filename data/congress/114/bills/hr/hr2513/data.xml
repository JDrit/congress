  <summary date="2015-05-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Promoting Access, Competition, and Equity Act of 2015 or the PACE Act of 2015

This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to&#160;ease application criteria and procedures for physician-owned hospitals to expand their facilities. Under current law, expansion of physician-owned hospitals is subject to certain limitations, such as those&#160;regarding the extent and frequency of expansion and requiring community output. The bill suspends these limitations&#160;with respect to applications for expansion&#160;filed before October 1, 2019.

Following the end of this suspension period, hospitals with consistently high quality ratings&#160;are included among those hospitals that may apply to expand their facilities. The Centers for Medicare&#160;&amp; Medicaid&#160;Services may not alter the methodology for computing a hospital's quality rating before October 1, 2019.

With respect to hospitals under development as of March 23, 2010, the bill extends to May 1, 2015, the date by which a hospital may qualify for an exception to the ownership or investment prohibition on physician self-referrals.

The bill also: (1) exempts physician-owned hospitals from specified documentation and coding adjustments, and (2) extends reductions in certain inflationary increases associated with Medicare payments for inpatient hospital services.</summary>
