This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the rules that apply to income derived from foreign countries designated as sponsors of international terrorism or with whom the United States does not have diplomatic relations.

The bill: (1) disallows a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to any country on income derived from one of the countries subject to the rules, (2) denies a deduction for the disallowed foreign tax credits, (3) doubles the tax rate on income derived from the countries subject to the rules, (4) and expands the definition of income derived from the countries.

The bill also eliminates the authority of the President to waive the denial of foreign tax credits with respect to taxes paid or accrued to a country that the Department of State has designated as a foreign country that repeatedly provides support for international terrorism. (Under current law, a waiver is permitted if the President determines that it is in the national interest of the United States and will expand trade and investment opportunities for U.S. companies in the country.)</summary>
