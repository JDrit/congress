  <summary date="2016-01-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Pay Stub Disclosure Act

This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require each employer to provide an initial disclosure to each employee who is not subject to certain exemptions from minimum wage and maximum hour requirements within 15 days after: (1) the employee is hired, or (2) specified information in the initial disclosure changes.

The information specified in that initial disclosure shall include:

 the pay rate and form of compensation; the name of the employer and any other name used by the employer to conduct business; and the physical address and telephone number of the employer's main office or principal place of business, and a mailing address if different from the first one. The bill specifies additional disclosures that must be in each pay stub, including the pay period covered, the employee's name and truncated Social Security number, the total hours worked by the employee, benefits, allowances, and reimbursements.

The bill also prescribes the form of the pay stub as well as employer notice requirements.

An employer shall keep records of the information disclosed in an employee's pay stub for three years from each stub's issuance.

In the event that an employee requests an inspection of his or her records, the employer shall provide copies of them for up to three years before the request.

The bill prescribes civil penalties for employer failure to comply with this Act.</summary>
