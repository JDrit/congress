This bill creates an exception to a limitation on premium pay for U.S. Secret Service personnel performing protective services during any year in which a presidential election is held to the extent that payment of such pay does not cause: (1) the aggregate total of basic and premium pay for any pay period to exceed the biweekly equivalent of the annual salary rate established for level I of the Executive Schedule; or (2) the total basic and premium pay in any calendar year to exceed the annual salary rate established for such level.

 Such additional premium pay shall not be considered or creditable as basic pay for purposes of retirement or any other purpose and shall not be used in computing payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave.

The Director of the Secret Service may act as the head of an agency in applying such annual limitation on premium pay in calendar years in which a presidential election is not held.</summary>
