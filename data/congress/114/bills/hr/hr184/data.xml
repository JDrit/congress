Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for the Tribe.

Prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities.

Requires North Carolina to exercise jurisdiction over all criminal offenses committed, and all civil actions that arise, on North Carolina lands owned by, or held in trust for, the Lumbee Tribe or any dependent Indian community of the Tribe.</summary>
