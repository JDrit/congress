This bill exempts from land use restrictions under the Land Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) land known as the Community Park in Louisa, Virginia, thus allowing the land to be used for activities designed to improve compliance with water quality standards. Currently, land acquired or developed with assistance from the LWCF must be used for public outdoor recreation use and may not be converted to other uses without the approval of the Department of the Interior.</summary>
