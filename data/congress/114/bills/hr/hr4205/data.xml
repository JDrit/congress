This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to permit "choose and cut" Christmas tree producers to opt out of USDA's Christmas Tree Promotion, Research, and Information Order with respect to trees sold directly to final consumers.

(The order was authorized by the Commodity Promotion, Research, and Information Act of 1996 and includes an assessment on Christmas tree producers to fund a promotion, research, and information program for fresh cut Christmas trees.)</summary>
