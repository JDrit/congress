This bill establishes a grant program to encourage, through public-private partnerships,&#160;the development and implementation by&#160;states and local educational agencies&#160;of sustainable engineering education programs in elementary and secondary schools. The National Science Foundation (NSF) shall administer the program.

Grantees may use funds to:

 research, review, and analyze the effectiveness of existing research-based instructional materials; select or develop new research-based instructional materials; teach students the overall analytical approached used in engineering; prepare students who may pursue engineering studies in college or enter careers related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; increase participation of underrepresented student groups in the engineering pipeline; and provide professional development for teachers to teach pre-college engineering. The NSF shall study and report on program activities and results.</summary>
