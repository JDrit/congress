This bill requires each public or private company that produces or sells products in interstate commerce and has gross annual revenues exceeding $1 million to submit to annual audits of its supply chains by an independent auditor to determine if the chains are free of child labor and forced labor.

The independent auditor shall determine in each audit either that:

 the company's products are produced without the use of child labor or forced labor; or if the auditor cannot be certain that child labor or forced labor was used, that the company's products may have been produced with the use of such labor.</summary>
