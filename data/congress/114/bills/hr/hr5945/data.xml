This bill amends title III (Unemployment Insurance) of the Social Security Act to allow states, rather than the Department of Labor, to determine whether an individual claiming unemployment compensation is an individual for whom suitable work is only available in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing.

The final rule issued by Labor on August 1, 2016, entitled "Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants" (81 Fed. Reg. 50298), shall have no force or effect.</summary>
