This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the Next Generation of Researchers Initiative in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to coordinate NIH policies and programs aimed at promoting and providing opportunities for new researchers and earlier research independence.

The NIH must: (1) promote policies and programs to improve opportunities for new researchers and promote earlier research independence; (2) develop, modify, or accelerate policies, as needed, to promote opportunities for new researchers and earlier research independence, including policies to enhance training opportunities for research-related career options, strengthen mentorship programs, enhance diversity efforts, and help new researchers obtain renewal funding; (3) coordinate with agencies and academic institutions to improve tracking of career progress of biomedical postdoctoral researchers and students; and (4) request the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study and report on policies affecting the next generation of researchers as part of a study on biomedical and behavioral research personnel.</summary>
