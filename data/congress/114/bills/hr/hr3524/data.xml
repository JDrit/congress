  <summary date="2015-09-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Equal Employment for All Act of 2015

This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act governing the use of consumer reports for employment purposes to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from furnishing an employer with a consumer report containing information on the consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity if the employer intends to use that information for any employment purposes, including denial of employment.

The bill does permit an employer to use such a consumer credit report, however, in either an employment decision or before taking an adverse employment action if:

 the consumer both authorizes procurement of the report and also applies for, or currently holds, employment that requires eligibility for access to classified information; or such use is otherwise required by law. An employer who has sought such a report may neither deny employment to nor make any other employment decision about a consumer because the consumer has not authorized the employer's procurement of the report.</summary>
