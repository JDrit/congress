 This bill states that it is U.S. policy to promote the civic, linguistic, and economic integration of immigrants and their young children into the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall award Initial Entry, Adjustment, and Citizenship Assistance grants to units of local government, community-based organizations, or public or private nonprofit organizations that provide direct assistance to immigrants to the United States.

Such grants shall be available for 10 fiscal years beginning with FY2018.

Assistance shall be available to a non-citizen who is seeking: (1) permanent residency or naturalization, or (2) relief from removal in order to remain lawfully in the United States.

 DHS may make grants on a competitive basis to state or local governments to improve the economic, linguistic, and civic integration of immigrants and their children. Such grants shall be available for 10 fiscal years beginning with FY2018.

The bill establishes in the Treasury the Integration Success Fund.

The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to revise the waiver of the English language naturalization requirement for senior individuals.</summary>
