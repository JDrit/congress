This bill directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the award on behalf of the Congress of a single gold medal to the 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, also known as the AVG Flying Tigers, collectively in recognition of their service to the nation.

Following its award the gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution where it will be displayed and made available for research.

It is the sense of Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal available for display elsewhere, particularly at other locations associated with the AVG Flying Tigers.</summary>
