  <summary date="2015-07-29T16:04:21Z" status="Passed House amended">First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act

 (Sec. 2) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for the purpose of domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism, to: (1) establish a program to provide surplus anthrax vaccines nearing the end of their labeled dates of use from the strategic national stockpile for administration to emergency response providers who are at high risk of exposure to anthrax and who voluntarily consent to such administration, (2) distribute disclosures regarding associated benefits and risks to end users, and (3) conduct outreach to educate emergency response providers about the program.

Requires DHS to: (1) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and assessments of the threats posed by anthrax from an act of terror; (2) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to an anthrax terror attack; and (3) share information and provide tailored analytical support on threats posed by anthrax to state, local, and tribal authorities, as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders.

Directs DHS, in coordination with HHS, to carry out a 24-month pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to emergency response providers. Requires DHS to: (1) establish a communication platform and education and training modules for such program, (2) conduct economic analysis of such program, (3) create a logistical platform for the anthrax vaccine request process, (4) select providers based in at least two states to participate, (5) provide to each participating provider disclosures and educational materials regarding the benefits and risks of any vaccine provided and of exposure to anthrax, and (6) submit annual reports on pilot program results and recommendations to improve pilot program participation. Requires the report to include a plan for continuation of the DHS program to provide vaccines to emergency response providers.</summary>
