  <summary date="2016-09-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Funding Accountability for Sexual Harassers Act

This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to address sexual discrimination in institutions of higher education.

Institutions must report a finding that an individual who is responsible for the scientific or technical direction of one of the institution's research and development grants awarded by the federal government was engaged in sexual discrimination to each department and agency that has awarded the institution those grants in the past 10 years.

Institutions must also report on formal complaints alleging sexual discrimination that were filed, but are incomplete because the institution has not carried out a grievance procedure.

Agencies must: (1) consider these reports when deciding if they should fund a grant, and (2) keep the reports for 10 years.

The National Academy of Sciences must study, and report on, the prevalence and impact of sexual harassment in higher education in science, engineering, and medical departments and programs.</summary>
