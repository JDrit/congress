  <summary date="2016-09-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the military department concerned, in the case of a military manufacturing arsenal, depot, or plant (a government-owned, government-operated defense plant of the Department of the Army that manufactures weapons, weapon components, or both), to authorize leases of and contracts for non-excess military property for a term of up to 25 years if it determines that such a lease or contract will promote the national defense or be in the public interest for the purpose of:

 helping to maintain the viability of such arsenal, depot, or plant and any military installations on which it is located; eliminating, or at least reducing, the cost of government ownership of the arsenal, depot, or plant; and leveraging private investment at the arsenal, depot, or plant through long-term facility use contracts, property management contracts, leases, or other agreements that support and advance the preceding purposes. The department concerned may delegate such authority to the commander of the major subordinate command of the Army responsible for the arsenal, depot, plant, or installation. The commander may approve such a lease or contract on a case-by-case or class basis. Any lease or contract approved utilizing such authority is subject to a 90-day hold period so that the Army real property manager may review it. If such manager disapproves of it, the agreement shall be null and void upon transmittal to the delegating authority of a written disapproval, including a justification, within the hold period. If no such disapproval is transmitted within such period, the agreement shall be deemed approved.

 If, by 60 days after receiving a disapproval, the delegating authority submits a new contract or lease that addresses the manager's concerns, it shall be deemed approved unless the manager transmits a disapproval within 30 days of submission.

 The authority under this bill shall terminate at the close of September 30, 2019.</summary>
