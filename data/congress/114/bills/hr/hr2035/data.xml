  <summary date="2015-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Supporting Colorectal Examination and Education Now Act of 2015 or the SCREEN Act of 2015

This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to maintain calendar year 2015 Medicare reimbursement rates for colonoscopy procedures for providers participating in colorectal cancer screening quality improvement registry.

Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing is eliminated for colorectal cancer screening tests, for the removal of tissue or other matter during the screening test, or for a follow-up procedure.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation shall test a payment and service delivery model that is a demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre-operative visit before screening colonoscopy and hepatitis C screening.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services must reduce the physician fee schedule conversion factor and the hospital outpatient department conversion factor to the extent necessary to reduce expenditures for related items and services to achieve budget-neutral results.</summary>
