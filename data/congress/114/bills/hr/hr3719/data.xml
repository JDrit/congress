This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to convene an interagency task force to develop, solicit input on, disseminate information about, and study implementation of best practices for pain management and prescription of pain medication.

It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Department of Justice to award grants:

 to implement comprehensive community-wide prevention strategies to address a rapid increase or high rate of opioid or prescription drug abuse; and to develop, implement, or expand treatment alternative to incarceration programs. This bill limits an individual's civil liability for harm caused by the emergency administration of an opioid overdose reversal drug (e.g., naloxone) if the individual:

 works or volunteers at an opioid overdose program and provides the drug, as a part the program, to an authorized individual who administers it; or administers the drug after obtaining it from a health care professional or as part of an opioid overdose program, or administers it pursuant to a prescription, and was educated on its administration. It amends the Controlled Substances Act to require an opioid treatment program that closes on any day to make arrangements for each patient to receive treatment during the closure, as necessary.

The bill reauthorizes the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program through FY2020.

It amends the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005 to include as a specified purpose of state-administered controlled substance monitoring systems ensuring that appropriate authorities have access to prescription history information for investigations.

The bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise and reauthorize through FY2020 the controlled substance monitoring program.</summary>
