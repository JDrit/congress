This bill declares that the President may not designate lands to be a new or expanded national monument unless within one year before a designation the Department of the Interior consults with each community, county, municipality, city, town, or township with boundaries within or adjacent to the land affected by the designation and obtains concurrence for the designation from:

 the governing body of each such community, county, municipality, city, town, or township; and the wildlife management and land management authorities and the governor of each state in which the new or expanded national monument would be located. Furthermore, a declaration of a national monument shall not:

 include private property without the informed written consent of the property owner; be construed to increase the amount of funding for the monument for any fiscal year; apply to more than 5,000 acres; or be used to create or expand a national monument located in specified counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Utah. Water rights associated with a national monument created or expanded by a declaration:

 may not be reserved expressly or by implication by such a declaration, and may be acquired for a national monument created or expanded by a declaration only according to the laws of the state in which the water rights are based.</summary>
