This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require public water systems to notify their customers of lead concentration levels in drinking water that exceed lead limits under national primary drinking water regulations.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must notify the public within 15 days of the lead levels exceeding those limits if the public water system or the state does not notify the public.

The EPA may notify the public or the local or state health department of the result of lead monitoring conducted by a public water system.</summary>
