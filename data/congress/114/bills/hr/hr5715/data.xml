(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Export-Import Bank from guaranteeing, insuring, extending credit, or participating in the extension of credit in connection with the export of U.S. goods or services sought by:

 the Government of Iran, an entity owned or controlled by it, an entity created under Iranian law, or a foreign subsidiary of such an entity; an entity involving the Government of Iran, owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, created under Iranian law, or a foreign subsidiary of such an entity; or a non-U.S. entity that, in the last five-years, has leased or sold aircraft to the Government of Iran, or a subsidiary or controlling parent of such a non-U.S. entity. The Bank must cancel approved financing if it finds that such financing has facilitated the export, sale, or lease of an aircraft to the Government of Iran or a related entity and must seek immediate recovery of any amount it has provided in connection with the transaction.</summary>
