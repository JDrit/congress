  <summary date="2015-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Prison Bureau Relief Act of 2015

This bill amends the federal criminal code to require the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to release early an offender who has completed at least half of his or her prison sentence if such offender has: (1) attained age 45, (2) committed no violent offenses, and (3) received no institutional disciplinary violations.

The bill modifies provisions related to computation of a federal prisoner's good time credit. Specifically, it allows an eligible federal prisoner to earn a maximum good time credit of 54 days per year of the sentence imposed (instead of 54 days per year of the sentence actually served). It also permits the BOP to restore good time credit previously denied, based on a prisoner maintaining good behavior. These modifications apply to an ongoing prison sentence imposed on or after November 1, 1987.</summary>
