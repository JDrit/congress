This bill revises military parental leave requirements to state that:

 a member of the armed forces, regardless of gender or marital status, shall be authorized to take at least 84 days of parental leave in connection with the birth of a child, a qualifying adoption of a child, or the placement of a child in foster care with the service member; and in the case of a dual military family, both service members shall be authorized to take parental leave. (The Department concerned shall permit the transfer of such leave between the two service members to accommodate individual family circumstances.) Such parental leave shall be in addition to other leave.

 Convalescent or other leave taken before childbirth by a pregnant service member shall not reduce the number parental leave days.</summary>
