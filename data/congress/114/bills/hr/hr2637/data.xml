This bill amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating any regulation or guidance that limits or prohibits new carbon dioxide emissions from a fossil fuel-fired power plant until it is certified:

 by the Department of Labor that the regulation or guidance will not generate a loss of employment, by the Congressional Budget Office that it will not result in a loss in the gross domestic product, by the Energy Information Administration that it will not generate an increase in electricity rates, and by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that it will not effect the reliability of electricity delivery.</summary>
