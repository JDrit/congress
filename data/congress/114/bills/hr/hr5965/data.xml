This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify campus security reporting requirements for an institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs.

Currently, an IHE must annually report certain crime statistics in the following categories: (1) criminal offenses; (2) criminal offenses motivated by bias (i.e., hate crimes); (3) domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking; and (4) arrests and referrals for disciplinary action. This bill expands the categories of reportable crime statistics to also include criminal offenses in which a firearm was present at the scene of the crime.

Additionally, it requires an IHE to include, in its annual security report provided to students and employees, a statement of its current policy on concealed carry or open carry of firearms.

An IHE must also disclose that policy on its website and in promotional materials.</summary>
