  <summary date="2016-06-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expanding Capacity for Health Outcomes Act or the ECHO Act

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with the Health Resources and Services Administration, to study technology-enabled collaborative learning and capacity building models and the ability of those models to improve patient care and provider education. (Such models connect specialists to primary care providers through videoconferencing to facilitate case-based learning, dissemination of best practices, and evaluation of outcomes.)

The Government Accountability Office must report on such models and HHS support for such models.</summary>
