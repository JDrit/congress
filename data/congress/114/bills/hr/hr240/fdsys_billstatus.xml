        <text>Floor summary: DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Israel motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to provide for a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that does not include dangerous, poison pill amendments. Given recent events overseas, this is not a time to endanger the safety and security of the American people. The House needs to pass a clean bill that would provide certainty to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Additionally, the motion increases funding for the DHS State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative program by $1.5 million each (for a total of $3 million) and reduces the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management account by the same amount.</text>

        <description>Amendment prevents use of any funds to: (1) carry-out the Executive actions announced on November 20, 2014 to grant deferred action to certain unlawful aliens and for other purposes, or four of the "Morton Memos" on prosecutorial discretion and immigration enforcement priorities issued in 2011 and 2012 that effectively prevent certain classes of unlawful aliens from being removed from the country; 2) declares that no funds may be used to carry-out any substantially similar policies to those defunded; 3) declares that the policies defunded and any substantially similar policies have no statutory or constitutional basis and therefore no legal effect; and 4) provides that no funds may be used to grant any Federal benefit to any alien as a result of the policies defunded.</description>
