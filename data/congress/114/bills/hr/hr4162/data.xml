This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to issue, and promote the purchase of, Clean Energy Victory Bonds to pay for the energy-related tax benefits established or extended by this Act.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to:

 extend through 2023 the tax credit for investment in solar energy property, geothermal heat pumps, fuel cell property, microturbine property, combined heat and power system property, and small wind energy property; allow an energy tax credit for investment in offshore wind facilities placed in service before January 1, 2022; extend through 2024 the tax credit for residential energy efficiency improvements; extend through 2023 the placed-in-service requirement for wind facilities and other renewable energy facilities for purposes of the tax credit for producing electricity from renewable resources; extend through 2023 the tax credit for nonbusiness residential energy property; allow a new tax credit, through 2024, for home energy efficiency improvements that increase energy efficiency by at least 20%; extend through 2023 the tax credit for new energy efficient homes; and increase, and extend through 2023, the tax deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings. The bill directs the Department of Energy to establish a voluntary voucher program, through 2018, for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles.</summary>
