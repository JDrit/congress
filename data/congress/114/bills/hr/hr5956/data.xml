This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise and reauthorize through FY2022 grants for substance abuse treatment services for children and adolescents. The grant program is expanded to cover young adults.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) must award grants for demonstration programs to: (1) expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders among adolescents and young adults, or (2) create and distribute for pediatric health care providers resources on medication-assisted treatment training and implementation.

AHRQ must report on the demonstration programs and the availability of medication-assisted treatment for adolescents and young adults. The report must include recommendations for ensuring such treatment is accessible.

The Government Accountability Office must study how federal agencies are addressing substance use and substance use disorders among adolescents and young adults.</summary>
