This bill authorizes a recipient of public transportation assistance to advertise and award a construction contract that includes requirements for employing veterans residing in or adjacent to any of the areas in which work is to be performed if:

 the project's estimated cost exceeds $10 million; there is no requirement to hire an individual who does not have relevant craft or trade work skills, unless the individual is subject to an apprenticeship or other training program; and the requirements do not compromise the project's quality, unreasonably delay its completion, or unreasonably increase its cost.</summary>
