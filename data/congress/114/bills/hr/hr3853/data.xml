This bill amends the federal criminal code to grant discretion to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to approve an application by, and issue a federal firearms license to, a gun dealer.

Additionally, it authorizes the ATF to conduct more than one compliance inspection during a 12-month period if, in the preceding two years, a court has found that a licensed gun dealer transferred a firearm unlawfully, or the Department of Justice (DOJ) has found that 10 or more firearms used in crimes have been traced back to the dealer.

Finally, the bill amends the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, to permit the ATF to require a licensed gun dealer to conduct a physical inventory if, in the preceding two years, a court has found that a licensed gun dealer transferred a firearm unlawfully or DOJ has found that 10 or more firearms used in crimes have been traced back to the dealer.</summary>
