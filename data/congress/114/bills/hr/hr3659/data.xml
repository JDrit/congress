This bill allows undocumented aliens to obtain health care coverage by amending: (1) the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the restriction of the&#160;tax credit for health care insurance premium assistance to persons lawfully present in the United States; and (2) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to eliminate restrictions of benefits&#160;under such Act, including cost-sharing reduction, pre-existing condition coverage, and minimum essential health care coverage, to persons lawfully present in the United States.&#160;This expanded coverage is effective for&#160;taxable or plan years beginning after December 31, 2015.

The bill also extends PPACA benefits to individuals who are granted deferral from removal under specified Department of Homeland Security deferred action&#160;plans. &#160;</summary>
