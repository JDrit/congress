This bill requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to phase out existing contracts with private prison companies and private community confinement facilities.

It amends the federal criminal code to require federal employees to perform the core correctional services&#8212;housing, safeguarding, protecting, and disciplining of offenders&#8212;at correctional facilities used by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) or the U.S. Marshals Service.

The bill also prohibits the BOP from entering into or maintaining contracts with private companies to manage community confinement facilities (e.g., halfway houses).

DOJ must evaluate the effectiveness of and develop guidelines for recidivism reduction programs at community confinement facilities.

The Marshals Service must annually inspect each correctional facility it uses for confinement.

The BOP must provide to prisoners, as part of prerelease procedures, information and counseling about: criminal record expungement; educational, employment, and treatment programs; and applications for public assistance programs. The BOP must also provide prisoners with post-release information about fines, assessments, surcharges, restitution, and other penalties.</summary>
