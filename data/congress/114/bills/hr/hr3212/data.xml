  <summary date="2016-07-25T13:41:14Z" status="Reported to House with amendment(s)">This bill amends the Grand Ronde Reservation Act to permit the Department of the Interior to accept real property located within the boundaries of the original 1857 reservation of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (comprising land within Polk and Yamhill Counties) that is transferred to the United States by or on behalf of the tribes.

Interior must treat applications to take land into trust within the boundaries of the original 1857 reservation as on-reservation trust acquisitions. Gaming is prohibited on such real property taken into trust, except for real property within two miles of a specified gaming facility. All real property taken into trust within those boundaries after September 9, 1988, is part of the tribes' reservation.</summary>
