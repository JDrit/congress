Federal agencies must support the cultural activities of Indian tribes and tribal organizations and carry out activities to promote understanding and awareness of Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

Any grants for which Indian tribes or tribal organizations are eligible may be used to: (1) support their efforts to present their story and culture, (2) revitalize Native American communities using the arts and humanities, and (3) carry out this Act.
