  <summary date="2015-04-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Ensuring Quality in the Unemployment Insurance Program (EQUIP) Act 

 Amends title III (Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to require state unemployment compensation (UC) laws to require, as a condition of UC eligibility for a benefit year, an applicant, before receiving any UC, to: (1) complete a substance abuse risk assessment; and (2) test negative for controlled substances within one week after the results of such assessment if the state determines that the applicant is a high-risk. Prescribes retesting requirements and UC payment suspensions for applicants who test positive.

Amends SSAct title XVIII (Medicare) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to provide funding for such substance abuse testing out of current funds appropriated for the Independent Payment Advisory Board and, after application of those funds, for the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan program.</summary>
