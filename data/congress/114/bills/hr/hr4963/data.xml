  <summary date="2016-04-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2016

This bill establishes within the Department of Justice (DOJ) an Office of Elder Justice to provide information, training, and technical assistance for state and local governments to investigate, prosecute, prevent, and mitigate the impact of elder abuse, exploitation, and neglect. The office must be headed by a director who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

It authorizes the Office of Elder Justice to award grants to states to develop, establish, and operate programs to improve the response to, investigation of, and prosecution of elder abuse cases. An eligible state must have a compensation program for crime victims and a multidisciplinary task force on elder justice.

DOJ must identify, collect, and publish data related to the incidence of elder abuse. It must also develop recommendations for collecting additional data related to elder abuse.

Finally, the bill amends the Social Security Act to include the director of the Office of Elder Justice as the alternate for the Attorney General on the Elder Justice Coordinating Council.</summary>
