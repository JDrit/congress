DXM Abuse Prevention Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of a drug containing dextromethorphan (DXM, a cough suppressant and drug of abuse) to an individual under age 18 unless the individual has a prescription or is actively enrolled in the military. Retailers selling DXM must implement a verification system to ensure compliance. Civil monetary penalties that escalate upon repeated violation are imposed.

(Sec. 3) Unfinished DXM may only be possessed by, distributed to, and received by persons registered with the Food and Drug Administration as producers of a drug or medical device or otherwise allowed to engage in the practice of pharmacy, pharmaceutical production, or manufacture or distribution of drug ingredients. Common carriers distributing unfinished DXM between authorized persons are exempted. Civil monetary penalties are imposed for possession and distribution violations.</summary>
