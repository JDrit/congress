  <summary date="2015-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Firearm Rights Equally Enforced Act or the FREE Act

Amends the federal criminal code to permit an individual who is not prohibited from receiving a firearm under federal law, and to whom a state has issued a license or permit either to carry a concealed firearm or to carry a firearm that is partially or fully visible to the public, to carry a firearm in any other state, subject to the limitations imposed by the state that issued the license or permit.

Authorizes a state to: (1) impose a less restrictive limitation than the state that issued the license or permit; and (2) condition the exercise of such right upon the payment of a fee, as long as such fee is not set at a level that unduly burdens the exercise of the right.</summary>
