(Sec. 3) This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to: (1)&#160;require a proxy advisory firm to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and (2) prohibit an unregistered proxy advisory firm from using interstate commerce to provide proxy-voting research, analysis, or recommendations to any client.

 With respect to such firms, the bill: (1)&#160;establishes procedures for&#160;both registration and termination of registration; (2) requires each firm to employ an ombudsman, designate a compliance officer, and file specified documents with the SEC; and (3) prohibits unfair, coercive, or abusive practices.

(Sec. 4) The SEC shall report annually on its website regarding registration applications and related matters.</summary>
