  <summary date="2016-04-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution expresses the sense of Congress that no transfer to Saudi Arabia of U.S. air-to-ground munitions should occur until the President certifies that Saudi Arabia: (1) demonstrates an ongoing effort to combat the mutual threat our nations face from foreign terrorist organizations, and (2) takes all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of civilian harm in the course of military actions.

No transfer of U.S. air-to-ground munitions may occur until the President certifies to Congress that Saudi Arabia:

 is not providing funding, material support, or lethal aid to foreign terrorist organizations; and its coalition partners are taking all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of civilian harm and exercising proportional use of force in the course of military actions; and its coalition partners are making demonstrable efforts to facilitate the flow of critical humanitarian aid and commercial goods; and is taking necessary measures to target designated foreign terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and affiliates of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as part of its military operations in Yemen.</summary>
