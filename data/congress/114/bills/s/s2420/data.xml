This bill amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to exempt Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) beneficiaries from work requirements if they are not offered a position in a state job training or workfare program.

The bill also exempts from work requirements veterans who are participating in certain programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or a state to further employment or rehabilitation goals. The bill permits the Department of Agriculture to allocate specified funds to states for the employment programs.</summary>
