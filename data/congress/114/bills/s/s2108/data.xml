  <summary date="2015-09-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Preserving Patient Access to Post-Acute Hospital Care Act of 2015

This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to delay by two additional years the application of negative payment adjustments under the "25-percent rule" to certain long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and satellite facilities. This rule reduces payments to a long-term care facility that admits proportionately more patients from any single hospital.

The bill also continues for two additional years the moratorium, for the purposes of Medicare, on establishing new LTCHs or increasing LTCH beds.</summary>
