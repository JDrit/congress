This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to deem a health professional volunteer providing primary health care to an individual at a community health center or through programs or events carried out by a center to be an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of any civil action that may arise from providing services to patients. For a volunteer to be covered by this liability protection, the Department of Health and Human Services must approve the center's application to sponsor the volunteer.</summary>
