This bill amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to:

 prohibit a state from imposing any additional conditions or requirements on the eligibility of an individual to cast a vote in a federal election by mail, except to the extent of setting a deadline for returning the ballot to the appropriate state or local election official; and require each state to mail ballots, not later than two weeks before the election, and at no charge, to individuals registered to vote in it. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to revise requirements for simultaneous application for voter registration and for a motor vehicle driver's license to authorize automatic voter registration of individuals through state motor vehicle authorities.</summary>
