This bill amends the Clean Air Act to repeal the renewable fuel standard, which requires transportation fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel.

The bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal a requirement that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency assess and report to Congress on the impact of the renewable fuel program on environmental issues, resource conservation issues, and the growth and use of cultivated invasive or noxious plants and their impact on the environment and agriculture.

The bill also nullifies certain regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations relating to the renewable fuel standard.</summary>
