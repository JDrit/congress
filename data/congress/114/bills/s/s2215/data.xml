This bill prohibits the Department of the Treasury from providing any discretionary performance award to any employee of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to whom there is substantial evidence of misconduct or a seriously delinquent tax debt. Treasury shall consider such a denial or withholding of a discretionary performance award as an action necessary to protect the integrity of the IRS, for purposes of any collective bargaining agreement.</summary>
