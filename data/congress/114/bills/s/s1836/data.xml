  <summary date="2015-07-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015

This bill prohibits, for a one-year period, the availability of federal funds for any purpose to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., or any of its affiliates or clinics, unless they certify that the affiliates and clinics will not perform, and will not provide any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion during such period.

The restriction will not apply in cases of rape or incest or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed.

The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture must seek repayment of federal assistance received by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., or any affiliate or clinic, if it violates the terms of the certification required by this Act.</summary>
