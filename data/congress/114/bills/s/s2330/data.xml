This bill amends the federal criminal code to modify the background check requirements for certain nonimmigrant aliens to purchase firearms in the United States.

Current law permits a licensed gun dealer to transfer a firearm to an unlicensed person, including a nonimmigrant alien lawfully admitted to the United States without a visa, if a submitted background check remains incomplete after three business days.

This bill adds a provision to prohibit a licensed gun dealer from completing a firearm transfer to a nonimmigrant alien lawfully admitted without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program prior to completion of a background check.

Additionally, it requires such background check to review records maintained by the International Criminal Police Organization (i.e., Interpol) and the country that issued the alien's passport.</summary>
