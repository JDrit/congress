 Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop an accelerating innovation in medicine (AIM) list of medical devices (or for any items or services related to furnishing such devices) for which, because of their inclusion on the list, insurance benefits and payments are prohibited under Medicare (either directly or on a capitated basis), with the result that no Medicare claim may be submitted and an individual who consents to receive such a device (or related items or services) is responsible for paying for it and any related items and services.

Directs the Secretary to post on a public HHS website or other publicly accessible media an updated list of the medical devices on the AIM list.</summary>
