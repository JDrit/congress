Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2015 or the POWER Act 

(Sec. 3) This bill requires the U.S. Attorney for a judicial district to lead at least one public event that promotes pro bono legal services as a critical way to: (1) empower survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and (2) engage citizens in assisting those survivors.

A special but similar rule applies to districts containing Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

Each U.S. Attorney shall: (1) have discretion on the design, organization, and implementation of such public events; and (2) seek to maximize an event's local impact and the access of such survivors to high-quality pro bono legal services.

(Sec. 5) The Department of Justice shall use existing funds to carry out this Act.</summary>
