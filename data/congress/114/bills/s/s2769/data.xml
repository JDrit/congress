  <summary date="2016-04-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to prohibit any air carrier that transports passengers by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation from reducing the size, width, padding, or pitch of seats; the amount of leg room per seat; or the width of aisles on such aircraft.

The FAA must prescribe regulations: (1) establishing minimum standards for space for the safety, health, and comfort of aircraft passengers; and (2) requiring each air carrier to prominently display on its website the amount of space available for each passenger on aircraft it operates.</summary>
