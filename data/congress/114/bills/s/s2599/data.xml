This bill prohibits certain entities that are subject to the enforcement authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from advertising a rate for a hotel room that does not include all required fees other than taxes and fees imposed by a government.

Violations are to be treated as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
