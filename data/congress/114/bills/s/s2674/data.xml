This bill authorizes the President, upon request of a governor of a state, to declare a major disaster relating to lead contamination of drinking water from a public water system. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must promulgate regulations to carry out such authority within 60 days of this Act's enactment.

In the case of such a declared major disaster, the federal coordinating officer appointed under the Robert T.
