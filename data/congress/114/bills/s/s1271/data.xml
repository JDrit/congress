This bill requires the Department of the Interior to issue regulations to: (1) prevent or minimize the venting and flaring of gas in oil and gas production operations on federal land onshore and offshore in the United States, and (2) promote the capture and beneficial use or reinjection of gas in such operations.

Such regulations shall also treat gas that is flared or vented in operations under a lease as production for which a royalty is required to be paid to the United States.

The Government Accountability Office shall assess such venting and flaring and estimate the volume of gas vented or flared in such operations each year.</summary>
