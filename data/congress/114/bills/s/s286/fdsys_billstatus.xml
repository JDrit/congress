          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Department of the Interior Tribal Self-Governance Act of 2015</b></p> <p> Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to revise the Department of the Interior's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements with Indian tribes. </p> <p>Directs Interior to negotiate contracts and funding agreements in good faith to maximize implementation of the self-determination policy.</p> <p>Adds administrative or other expenses incurred by the governing body of the Indian tribe or tribal organization to the contract support costs eligible to receive funding under the Act. </p> <p>Establishes the Tribal Self-Governance Program and sets forth eligibility requirements. Makes tribes eligible to receive grants for planning to participate in the program or for negotiating the terms of participation.</p> <p>Requires funding agreements to specify services to be provided, functions to be performed, and the responsibilities of the Indian tribe and Interior. Permits a funding agreement to provide for a base budget specifying recurring funds to be transferred to the tribe. </p> <p>Directs Interior to enter into a compact with each tribe participating in self-governance in a manner consistent with the trust responsibility of the federal government, treaty obligations, and the government-to-government relationship between tribes and the United States. </p> <p>Specifies requirements for tribes participating in self-governance with respect to conflicts of interest, audits, redesign and consolidation of programs, retrocession of programs, non-duplication of funding, and records.</p> <p>Requires a funding agreement to include provisions for Interior to monitor the performance of trust functions by the tribe and to reassume a program and funding under specified circumstances. </p> <p>Prohibits a tribe from being obligated to continue performance of a compact or funding agreement with insufficient funds.</p> <p> Sets forth requirements for reports, regulations, and judicial review. </p>]]></text>

Modifies Interior's process to make it similar to processes used by the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service. </p> <p>(Sec. 101) Revises the definition of &quot;self-determination contract&quot; to state that no contract shall be considered to be a procurement contract or subject to federal procurement law, except for specified construction contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Directs Interior to negotiate contracts and funding agreements in good faith to maximize implementation of the self-determination policy. Requires provisions of contracts or funding agreements to be liberally construed for the benefit of the Indian tribe.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) Directs Interior to interpret all federal laws, regulations, and executive orders in a manner that facilitates: (1) inclusion in self-determination contracts and funding agreements of applicable programs, services, and related funds; (2) implementation of self-determination contracts and funding agreements; and (3) achievement of tribal health objectives.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) Adds administrative or other expenses incurred by the governing body of the Indian tribe or tribal organization to the contract support costs eligible to receive funding under the Act.

Permits a funding agreement, at the request of a tribe, to provide for a base budget specifying recurring funds to be transferred to the tribe. </p> <p>Prohibits Interior from waiving the trust responsibility of the United States to tribes or altering the terms of a funding agreement without tribal consent. </p> <p>Permits tribes participating in self-governance on the date of enactment of this bill to retain existing funding agreements or renegotiate a new funding agreement, including a multiyear funding agreement. </p> <p>Directs Interior to negotiate and enter into a compact with each Indian tribe participating in self-governance in a manner consistent with the trust responsibility of the federal government, treaty obligations, and the government-to-government relationship between tribes and the United States.
