  <summary date="2015-11-05T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2015

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to report annually on its research activities, including a study of congenital heart disease, from birth to adulthood, that considers health care utilization, demographic factors, and outcomes. (Congenital heart disease is a condition caused by a heart defect that is present at birth.)

The CDC must implement an awareness, outreach, and education campaign regarding congenital heart disease.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute must report on its ongoing research efforts regarding congenital heart disease, future plans for such research, and areas of greatest need for such research.</summary>
