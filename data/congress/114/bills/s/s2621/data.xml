This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require food that contains an ingredient from a genetically modified organism (GMO) to be labeled as genetically engineered.

A food is exempt from this requirement if GMO ingredients account for less than 0.9% of the food's weight. A food is not subject to this requirement solely because: (1) a genetically engineered vaccine was used at any point in the production of the food, or (2) it was produced using a processing aid or enzyme that was produced from a GMO.

The labeling requirements of this bill preempt state and local labeling requirements.</summary>
