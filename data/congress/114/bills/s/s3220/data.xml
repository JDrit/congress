This bill amends the Fair Housing Act to identify certain unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in or around a dwelling that is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to constitute a discriminatory housing practice based on hostile environment sexual harassment. Such conduct consists of: (1) an unwelcome sexual advance, including groping or touching; (2) an unwelcome request for sexual favors; or (3) any other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is intended to be coercive, threatening, or intimidating.</summary>
