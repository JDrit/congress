  <summary date="2016-04-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ensuring Children&#8217;s Access to Specialty Care Act of 2016

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to include pediatric subspecialties in primary health services for purposes of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). Psychiatrists who are pediatric subspecialists are included in behavioral and mental health professionals. (These amendments make pediatric subspecialists, including psychiatrists, eligible for the NHSC fellowship program for the delivery of primary health services in health professional shortage areas, the NHSC Scholarship Program, and the NHSC Loan Repayment Program.)

&#8220;Health professional shortage area&#8221; can mean an underserved population of children and adolescents.</summary>
