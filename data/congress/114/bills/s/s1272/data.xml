  <summary date="2015-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill directs the Government Accountability Office to study the effects of forward capacity auctions or other capacity mechanisms established by Independent System Operators or Regional Transmission Organizations with respect to:

 consumer prices for electricity; installation of new electrical generation systems; preservation of existing electrical generation systems; and competition in energy markets, including the potential for the use of undue market power or manipulation in the auctions. The report to Congress on the study must assess whether the auctions or capacity mechanisms are producing rates that are just and reasonable.</summary>
