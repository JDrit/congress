  <summary date="2015-05-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Act

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 to make the J-1 visa waiver (Conrad state 30/medical services in underserved areas) program permanent.

Sets forth specified employment protections and contract requirements for alien physicians working in underserved areas, including a six-month status extension for a physician whose application his been denied by an oversubscribed state who then agrees to work in an undersubscribed state.

Increases the number of alien physicians that a state may be allocated from 30 to 35 per fiscal year under specified circumstances. Provides for additional increases or decreases based upon demand.

Provides up to three visa waivers per fiscal year per state for physicians in academic medical centers.

Permits dual intent for an alien coming to the United States to receive graduate medical education or training, or to take examinations required for graduate medical education or training.

Exempts H-1B nonimmigrant aliens seeking to enter the United States to pursue graduate medical education or training from specified entry limitations.</summary>
