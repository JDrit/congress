  <summary date="2015-07-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Energy Efficient Government Technology Act 

This bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to require each federal agency to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop an implementation strategy for the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies. The OMB must establish performance goals for evaluating the efforts of federal agencies in improving the maintenance, purchase, and use of the technology. The Chief Information Officers Council must recommend best practices for attaining the performance goals.

DOE must:

 make available to the public an update to the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency published on August 2, 2007; carry out a data center energy practitioner program that leads to the certification of energy practitioners qualified to evaluate the energy usage and efficiency opportunities in federal data centers; carry out an open data initiative to make information about federal data center energy usage available and accessible in a manner that encourages data center innovation, optimization, and consolidation; participate in efforts to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency; and facilitate in the development of an efficiency metric that measures the energy efficiency of a data center.</summary>
