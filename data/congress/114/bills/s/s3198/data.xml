  <summary date="2016-07-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">State Veterans Home Adult Day Health Care Improvement Act of 2016

This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to enter into an agreement or a contract with each state home to pay for medical supervision model adult day health care for a veteran for whom the home is not receiving VA nursing home care payments.

The veteran must need such care either specifically for a service-connected disability, or, if not specifically for one, the veteran must have a service-connected disability rated 70% or more.

Payment under each agreement or contract between the VA and a state home must equal 65% of the payment that the VA would otherwise pay to the state home if the veteran were receiving nursing home care.

 "Medical supervision model adult day health care" means adult day health care that includes the coordination of physician services, dental services, the administration of drugs, and such other requirements as the VA may determine.</summary>
