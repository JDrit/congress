This bill amends the Clayton Act with respect to actions brought by the Attorney General for violations of antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is required, but only under the Clayton Act, to exercise the same authority and procedures of the Attorney General specified in the Act with respect to the prohibition against acquisition by one corporation of the stock of another (merger) that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.

The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) is amended to exclude proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, or similar transactions from FTC proceedings, except in cases where the FTC approves an agreement with the parties to the transaction that contains a consent order.

Jurisdiction is granted to the U.S. district courts to issue writs of mandamus commanding compliance with the FTCA or any FTC order, if the FTC applies to such courts with respect to any activity related to consummation of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or similar transaction that results in an unfair method of competition.</summary>
