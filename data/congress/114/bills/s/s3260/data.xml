This bill amends the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 to provide liability protection to volunteers of a volunteer pilot nonprofit organization that arranges flights for public benefit in the case of harm caused by an act or omission of a volunteer on behalf of the organization. Volunteers shall not be liable if they: (1) were operating an aircraft in furtherance of the purpose of, and acting within the scope of their volunteer responsibilities on behalf of, the nonprofit organization; (2) were properly licensed and insured for the operation of the aircraft; (3) were in compliance with all requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration for recent flight experience; and (4) did not cause the harm through willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer.</summary>
