  <summary date="2016-02-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Combating BDS Act of 2016

This bill authorizes a state or local government to adopt and enforce measures to divest its assets from, or prohibit investment of its assets in: (1) an entity that such government determines, using credible information available to the public, engages in a commerce or investment-related boycott, divestment, or sanctions activity targeting Israel; or (2) an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with, such an entity. Such government shall provide written notice to such an entity before applying such a measure.

Such a measure by a state or local government is not preempted by any federal law. The bill applies to any measure adopted by a state or local government before, on, or after the date of this Act's enactment.

The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to prohibit any person from bringing any civil, criminal, or administrative action against any registered investment company, or any officer or employee thereof, based solely upon such company divesting from, or avoiding investing in, securities issued by persons that such company determines, using credible information available to the public, engage in any commerce or investment-related boycotts, divestments, or sanctions activities targeting Israel.</summary>
