  <summary date="2016-04-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Department of Defense (DOD) civilian public shipyard workers play a critical role in maintaining U.S. ships and submarines; and (2) in order to reduce temporary duty expenses DOD should eliminate unnecessary temporary duty and not cut the reimbursement rate for workers undertaking temporary duty to sustain military readiness, such as temporary duty in support of ship and submarine maintenance.

The bill requires that DOD Joint Travel Regulations be modified to require that: (1) the reduced flat rate per diem for long-term temporary duty not be imposed on civilian employees of naval shipyards traveling on such duty for direct labor in support of off-yard work, and (2) those employees be paid the full per diem rate for such travel.</summary>
