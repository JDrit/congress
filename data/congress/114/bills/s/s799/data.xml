Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review its activities related to prenatal opioid use, including neonatal abstinence syndrome, and develop a strategy to address gaps in research and gaps and overlap in programs. (An opioid is a drug with effects similar to opium, such as heroin or certain pain medications. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is withdrawal in a newborn.)

(Sec. 3) HHS must conduct a study and develop recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid use disorders, including the effects of those disorders on infants. HHS must publish a report that includes:

 an assessment of existing research on neonatal abstinence syndrome; an evaluation of the causes, and barriers to treatment, of opioid use disorders among women of reproductive age and recommendations on preventing opioid use disorders in these women; an evaluation of, and recommendations on, treatment for pregnant women with opioid use disorders and the effects of prenatal opioid use on infants; and an evaluation of the differences in prenatal opioid use between demographic groups and recommendations on reducing disparities. (Sec. 4) HHS may continue providing technical assistance: (1) to states and Indian tribes to improve neonatal abstinence syndrome surveillance; and (2) to states to support implementation of effective public health measures, such as disseminating information to educate the public on prenatal opioid use and neonatal abstinence syndrome.</summary>
