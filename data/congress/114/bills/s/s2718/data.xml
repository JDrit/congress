This bill amends the Carl D.

 career and technical education programs that are aligned with postsecondary education programs, dual or concurrent enrollment programs and early college programs, certain evidence-based strategies and delivery models related to career and technical education, teacher and leader experiential and informational-gathering site visits, professional development of educators and business partners, structured interdisciplinary collaboration and common planning time, teacher and leader externship programs, cross-credentialing for teachers, paid student internships or other paid work-based learning experiences, and guidance counseling. Unless granted a waiver, a grant recipient must provide specified matching funds in the fourth and fifth years of the five-year grant.</summary>
