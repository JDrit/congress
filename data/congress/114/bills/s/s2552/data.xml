This bill amends the federal criminal code to modify the provision that prohibits transmitting in interstate commerce a communication that contains a threat to injure another person (i.e., the federal threat statute).

Specifically, it adds criminal intent as an element for a criminal offense under the federal threat statute. The government must prove that a defendant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly transmitted a communication that contained a threat.

Additionally, the bill revises the manner of transmission with respect to such communication to include the mail or any facility or means of interstate commerce.</summary>
