This bill prohibits federal funds from being expended for abortion or health coverage that includes coverage of abortion. Abortions are eligible for federal funding only in cases of rape or incest, or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed. Currently, federal funding of abortion and health coverage that includes abortion is prohibited, with the same exceptions.</summary>
