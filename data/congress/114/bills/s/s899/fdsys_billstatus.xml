(Subgrants are awarded on a competitive basis to local educational agencies, community-based organizations, and other public or private entities to establish or expand before school, after school, and summer recess community learning center programs.)</p> <p>Authorizes subgrantees to establish community learning center programs that partner with in-demand fields of the local workforce or build career competencies and career readiness.</p>]]></text>
