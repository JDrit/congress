Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase, as of December 1, 2015, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children.

 Requires each such increase to be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date.

Directs the VA to publish the increased amounts in the Federal Register.

 Authorizes the VA to adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made by this Act, the rates of disability compensation payable to persons who have not received compensation for a service-connected disability.</summary>
