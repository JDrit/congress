This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to make grants to states to establish, expand, or maintain culturally competent programs for maternal depression screening and treatment. HRSA must give priority to states proposing to expand or enhance screening for maternal depression in primary care settings.

Activities eligible for funding: (1) must include providing to health care providers training and resources, including information on maternal depression screening, treatment, and follow-up support, and linkages to community-based resources; and (2) may include enabling real-time psychiatric consultation to aid in the treatment of pregnant and postpartum women, conducting a public awareness campaign, funding start-up costs, and establishing linkages with and among community-based resources.</summary>
