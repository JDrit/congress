This bill amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to extend through calendar 2020 the payment increase (add-on) for Medicare home health services in rural areas.

 The ceiling on the total amount of the additional payments or payment adjustments otherwise made in the case of home health outliers with respect to a fiscal year or year is lowered, in the case of each of 2016 through 2020, from 2.5% to 2.25% of the total payments projected or estimated to be made under the prospective payment system for home health services.</summary>
