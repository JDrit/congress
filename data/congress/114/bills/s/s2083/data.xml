(Sec. 1) This bill permits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), upon licensee request, to extend for up to three consecutive two-year periods from the expiration date of the extension originally issued by FERC the time period during which the licensee must commence construction of project numbered 12642.

FERC may also reinstate the license effective as of its expiration date if the period required for commencement of project construction has expired before enactment of this Act. The first extension authorized under this Act shall take effect upon that expiration date.</summary>
