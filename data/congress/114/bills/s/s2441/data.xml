This bill amends the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, and the Immigration and Nationality Act to make Cuban nationals who enter the United States on or after the enactment of this Act ineligible for refugee/parolee assistance.

The Inspector General of the Social Security Administration shall report to Congress on methods for enforcing the loss of eligibility under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled) of the Social Security Act by persons who are absent from the United States for at least one month.</summary>
