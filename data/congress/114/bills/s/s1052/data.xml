  <summary date="2015-04-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to study and report on: (1) the impact of state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies, and associated building efficiency policies, for commercial and multifamily buildings; (2) the impact of programs and systems in which utilities provide aggregated information regarding whole building energy consumption and usage information to owners of multitenant buildings; and (3) the best practice policy approaches studied in those impact analyses that have resulted in the greatest improvements in building energy efficiency.

DOE may give grants to: (1) utilities, utility regulators, and utility partners to implement programs to provide aggregated whole building energy consumption information to multitenant building owners; and (2) states and local governments to implement benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings.</summary>
