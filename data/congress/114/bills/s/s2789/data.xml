This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establish and operate the following programs free of charge:

 online tax preparation and filing software, a program for taxpayers to download third-party provided return information relating to individual income tax returns, and a program to permit individuals with simplified tax situations to elect to have the IRS prepare their returns. The IRS may not enter into any agreement which restricts its legal right to provide tax return preparation services, software, or tax return filing services. An individual participating in the programs established by this bill must verify their identity to the satisfaction of the IRS.</summary>
