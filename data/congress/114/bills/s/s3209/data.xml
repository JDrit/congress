This bill requires a state that receives grant funds under the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) or the controlled substance monitoring program to comply with specified requirements. The Department of Justice (DOJ) or Department of Health and Human Services may withhold grant funds from a state that fails to comply.

Additionally, the bill requires a state to share its PDMP data with other states through a data-sharing hub established by DOJ.</summary>
