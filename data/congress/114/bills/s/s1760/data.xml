This bill amends the federal criminal code to make trafficking in firearms a crime. Specifically, it prohibits, with respect to two or more firearms, the following:

 transfer to or receipt by a prohibited person or a person who plans a subsequent transfer that results in unlawful use, possession, or disposition of such firearms; providing false statements in connection with the purchase, receipt, or acquisition of such firearms; and directing, promoting, or facilitating such prohibited conduct. A person who commits or conspires to commit a gun trafficking offense is subject to a prison term of up to 20 years (or 25 years if such person also acted as an organizer).&#160;

The U.S. Sentencing Commission must review and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements that apply to persons convicted of trafficking in firearms.</summary>
