  <summary date="2016-06-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Climate Change Education Act 

 This bill declares that the evidence for human-induced climate change is overwhelming and undeniable.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must establish a Climate Change Education Program to:

 broaden the understanding of human-induced climate change, possible consequences, and potential solutions; apply the latest scientific and technological discoveries to provide learning opportunities to people of all ages; conduct a national information campaign to help people understand and promote implementation of new technologies, programs, and incentives related to energy conservation, renewable energy, and greenhouse gas reduction; and inform the public of impacts to human health and safety as a result of climate change. NOAA must establish a grant program for climate change education. This grant program must be included in the climate change program.</summary>
