This bill amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to require a state that receives a formula grant under the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention program to limit the use of restraints with respect to pregnant juvenile offenders.

Specifically, the legislation requires a state's juvenile justice plan to: (1) contain a plan to limit restraints during pregnancy and eliminate restraints during labor, delivery, and post-partum recovery, unless a pregnant juvenile offender poses a serious threat of harm or credible risk of escape; and (2) describe the policies, procedures, and training for state correctional facility staff to eliminate dangerous practices related to pregnant juveniles, including unreasonable restraints. &#160;</summary>
