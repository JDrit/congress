  <summary date="2016-05-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Veterans Acquiring Community Care Expect Safe Services Act of 2016 or the Veterans ACCESS Act

This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to deny or revoke a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services to veterans if such provider: (1) was removed from VA employment for violating VA policy, (2) violated medical license requirements, (3) had a VA certification revoked, or (4) violated a law for which a prison term of more than one year may be imposed.

The VA may deny, revoke, or suspend a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services if the VA has reasonable belief that such action is necessary to protect the health or safety of veterans and: (1) the provider is under investigation by the medical board of a state in which the provider is licensed or practices, (2) the provider has entered into a settlement agreement for a medical-related disciplinary charge, or (3) the VA otherwise determines that such action is appropriate.

The VA shall suspend a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services to veterans if such provider is suspended from VA service.</summary>
