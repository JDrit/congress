  <summary date="2015-08-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Airline Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act of 2015

This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to clarify, and to require air carriers (including foreign carriers) to clarify, that 1:1,000 epinephrine ampules included in emergency medical kits carried on aircraft are to be used for the treatment of anaphylaxis.

The FAA shall require an air carrier to:

 carry on each aircraft at least two packs of epinephrine auto-injectors for use as the initial treatment for anaphylaxis, replace them upon expiration or use, and train air crewmembers on how to recognize the symptoms of an acute allergic reaction and administer auto-injectable epinephrine. The Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress on air carrier policies relating to passengers with food allergies.</summary>
