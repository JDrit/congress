This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to ease restrictions on health insurance plans without pediatric dental benefits (an essential health benefit) to allow such insurance to be offered in any service area where a dental plan in the individual or small group market provides pediatric dental benefits, even if the dental plan is not offered on the health insurance exchange.</summary>
