Such authorization shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any state that: (1) permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property; or (2) prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base, or park.</p>]]></text>
