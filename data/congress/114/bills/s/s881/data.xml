This bill amends the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to specify the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Credit Union Administration Board as the federal agency representatives on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council which are required, along with the Council, to review all Council-prescribed regulations at least once every 10 years in order to identify outdated or unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed upon financial institutions (currently, only insured depository institutions).

 This decennial review shall include all regulations issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</summary>
