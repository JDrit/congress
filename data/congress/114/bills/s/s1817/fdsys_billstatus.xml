The bill requires subsequent assessments, within specified time frames, of a major rule that remains in effect after an assessment under this bill, unless the OIRA determines that there is a foreseeable and apparent need for such rule beyond such time frames.</p> <p>The OIRA must: </p> <ul> <li> issue guidance for agencies regarding the development of the framework for, and the conduct of, such assessments; </li> <li> oversee the compliance of agencies with this Act; </li> <li> ensure that the results of each assessment are published promptly on a centralized federal website and that required notice is published in the Federal Register; </li> <li> encourage and assist agencies to streamline and coordinate the assessment of major rules with similar or related regulatory objectives; </li> <li> exempt an agency from such framework requirements if the agency did not issue a notice of proposed rule making for the major rule in order to provide a timely response to an emergency or to comply with a statutorily imposed deadline (in which cases the framework must be published within six months after the agency publishes the final rule); and </li> <li> extend the deadline specified by an agency for an assessment for up to 90 days if the agency justifies why it is unable to meet that deadline.</li> </ul> <p>These provisions shall not apply to:</p> <ul> <li>a major rule of an agency that the OIRA reviewed before this bill's enactment or for which the agency is required to conduct a retrospective review under any other provision of law that meets or exceeds the requirements of this bill;</li> <li>interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; or</li> <li>routine and administrative rules.</li> </ul>  <p> Judicial review of agency compliance is limited to whether an agency published the framework for assessment of a major rule or whether an agency completed and published the required assessment of a major rule. The court may only issue an order remanding the rule to the agency to comply with this bill. Any determination, action, or inaction of the OIRA shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>]]></text>
