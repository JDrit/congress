  <summary date="2016-09-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes the importance of U.S. and international assistance to the people of Lebanon in order to build Lebanon's capacity to provide services and security, and particularly to curb Hezbollah's influence.

Encourages coordination between the Department of State, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and humanitarian organizations to ensure that refugees from the conflict in Syria are supported so as to mitigate any destabilizing effect on their host countries.

Recognizes that it is in U.S. interests to support negotiations to end the conflict in Syria, which would allow for the eventual return of the millions of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and other countries.

Supports full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 (calling for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon).

Recognizes the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as the sole institution entrusted with the defense of Lebanon's sovereignty and supports U.S. partnerships with the LAF, particularly through the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).</summary>
