 Urges China to halt suppression of the religious, cultural, social, economic, and environmental rights of the Tibetan people in Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's home regions of Lithang and Nyagchu and across all areas of traditional Tibet.

 Declares that violations of human rights in general and the persecution of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, his family, and his supporters are matters of worldwide concern.</summary>
