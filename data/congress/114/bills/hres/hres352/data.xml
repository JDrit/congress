 Requests that the President issue a proclamation recognizing Prisoners of Conscience Day.

Encourages Members of Congress to raise individual prisoner of conscience cases in Congress, with the executive branch, with their constituents, to foreign governments and multilateral organizations, and during delegation trips abroad.

Encourages the U.S. government to: (1) implement policies that support human rights programs, and (2) undertake actions directed at countries that detain prisoners of conscience in violation of international standards.

Urges that advocacy on behalf of prisoners of conscience be pursued at every level of U.S. foreign policy and in all bilateral and multilateral engagements.</summary>
