  <summary date="2016-03-01T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Affirms that it is in the U.S. national interest to become a formal signatory to the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea.

 Urges the Senate to give its advice and consent to the convention's ratification.

Recommends the ratification remain a top Administration priority, having received bipartisan support from every President since 1994, and having most recently been underscored by the strategic challenges the United States faces in the Asia-Pacific region and more specifically in the South China Sea.</summary>
