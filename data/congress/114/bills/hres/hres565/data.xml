  <summary date="2015-12-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes the importance of the negotiations between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

 Commends Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who has demonstrated vision and leadership in seeking a negotiated settlement to end the conflict and lay the foundations for a sustainable peace.

 Calls on the negotiating parties to address the demands of victims of violence for truth, justice, meaningful reparations, and guarantees that the past violence will not be repeated.

 Urges President Barack Obama and his Administration to support these negotiations and to develop plans to support the Colombian people in building a just and lasting peace.</summary>
