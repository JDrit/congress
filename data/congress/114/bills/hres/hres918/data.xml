  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that the House of Representatives:

 supports policies that provide necessary resources to serve veterans by maintaining a robust Veterans Health Administration (VHA); opposes policies that would jeopardize care for veterans by moving essential resources away from the VHA and into the private sector; and supports policies that would create integrated health care networks for veterans, with the VHA serving as the coordinator and primary provider of care and selected high-quality community partners providing care as needed to ensure timely and convenient access for enrolled veterans.</summary>
