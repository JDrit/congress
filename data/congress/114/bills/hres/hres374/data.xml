Applauds Singapore's leadership in counterterrorism, including the deployment of military assets as part of the anti-ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) coalition and innovative counterterrorism efforts within the Asia-Pacific region.

Anticipates the deepening of the security relationship following the signing of an enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement on December 7, 2015, and welcomes further cooperation in areas such as cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and defense technology.

Recognizes the vitality of the U.S.-Singapore bilateral trade and investment relationship.

Expresses support for continued close cooperation between the United States and Singapore to build capacity for commercial engagement, energy development, innovation, trade facilitation, and to achieve development goals in the Asia-Pacific region.

Urges the Administration to continue its support of multilateral institutions and fora, working in close cooperation with partners, such as Singapore, who share a commitment to an inclusive, rules-based regional architecture.</summary>
