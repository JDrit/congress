  <summary date="2016-09-28T15:11:18Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses concern about the disappearance of David Louis Sneddon in Yunnan Province, China, in August 2004.

 Encourages: (1) the Department of State and the intelligence community to continue joint investigations, coordinate investigations with the governments of China, Japan, and South Korea, and solicit information from regional affairs and law enforcement experts on plausible explanations for Sneddon's disappearance; (2) the State Department to work with foreign governments known to have diplomatic influence with North Korea; and (3) the intelligence community to assess the possibility of North Korea's involvement in Sneddon's disappearance and to seek his recovery.

Requests the State Department and the intelligence community to continue to work with and inform Congress and Sneddon's family on efforts to resolve his disappearance.</summary>
