  <summary date="2015-11-03T15:10:42Z" status="Passed House amended">Urges the U.S. government to work with European governments and European law enforcement agencies encouraging them to:

 partner with, share information, and train Jewish community groups to strengthen preparedness and response to anti-Semitic attacks and to support related research initiatives; consider formal partnerships in the United States, United Kingdom, and France between government entities and Jewish community security groups as examples of such partnering; support assessments of the environments of hate crimes and anti-Semitism, including analysis of crimes and law enforcement and community response, and cooperation between European governments and intergovernmental and inter-organizational entities, and use these assessments to adjust efforts to combat anti-Semitism; help Jewish communities develop safety standards; consider developing a standardized pan-European information-sharing and alerting system among governments, inter-governmental agencies, and Jewish communities; work for the implementation of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe declarations and decisions, particularly those focusing on anti-Semitism; ensure that law enforcement personnel are trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence, and that senior officials with commensurate authority and resources have been appointed to combat anti-Semitism; integrate efforts to combat violent extremism and efforts to combat anti-Semitism; and work with law enforcement associations and other relevant professional entities to combat anti-Semitism and to actualize the goals of this resolution. Supports the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy priority of fostering international religious freedom.

Urges the Department of State to continue U.S. reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism.</summary>
