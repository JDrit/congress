  <summary date="2015-10-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Reaffirms that granting of presidential waiver authority for certain sanctions against Iran by Congress was to be used when specific behavioral improvements have been met by Iran.

 Reaffirms the commitment of the House of Representatives to preventing the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran as the premise for such sanctions and presidential waiver authority.

 Reaffirms the intent of the House of Representatives not to provide presidential waiver authority for such sanctions for purposes of conducting negotiations with Iran that do not result in the prevention of a nuclear-armed Iran.

 Reaffirms that the President does not have the authority as granted by Congress to change current law by exercising presidential waiver authority for certain sanctions on a general basis for purposes of entering into a treaty relating to Iran's nuclear program.

Reaffirms that exercising presidential waiver authority to grant relief from certain sanctions against Iran in an effort to change Iran's support for acts of international terrorism, violation of human rights, weapons and missile development and acquisition, arms export, and development of a nuclear program shall not be recognized by Congress.</summary>
