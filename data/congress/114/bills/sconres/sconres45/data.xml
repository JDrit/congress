Urges fossil fuel companies and allied organizations to cooperate with active or future investigations into:

 their climate change-related activities, what they knew about climate change and when they knew of it, what they knew about the harmful effects of fossil fuels on the climate, and any activities to mislead the public about climate change.</summary>
