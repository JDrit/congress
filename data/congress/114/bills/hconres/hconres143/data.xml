  <summary date="2016-07-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Disapproves of activities by certain corporations and trade associations, foundations, and organizations funded by those corporations deliberately to: (1) mislead the public and undermine peer-reviewed scientific research about the dangers of their products, and (2) cast doubt on science in order to protect their financial interests.

Urges fossil fuel companies and allied organizations to cooperate with active or future investigations into:

 their climate change-related activities, what they knew about climate change and when they knew of it, what they knew about the harmful effects of fossil fuels on the climate, and any activities to mislead the public about climate change.</summary>
