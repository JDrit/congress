        <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute numbered 6 printed in House Report 114-49 to increase new budget authority for the Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism function (Function 970) by $2 billion, from $94 billion to $96 billion in Fiscal Year 2016. The amendment increases the outlay amounts for OCO over the period of Fiscal Years 2016 to 2025. As a consequence of the increase in OCO/GWOT, conforming increases are made in total budget authority and outlays, deficits, interest, debt subject to limit, and debt held by the public. The amendment also strikes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism in section 513 of the reported resolution.</purpose>

        <purpose>An amendment numbered 2 printed in House Report 114-49 to make investments in education, job training, transportation and infrastructure, and advanced research and development programs that will help the economic recovery. It includes funding for a comprehensive jobs bill and targeted investments to reduce the poverty in America. The CBC budget protects the social safety net without cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or SNAP. It raises new revenue by making our tax system fairer, saving more than $1.9 trillion on the deficit over the next decade and reduces the annual budget deficit to 2.3% of GDP by FY 2025.</purpose>

        <text>Rule provides for consideration of H. Con. Res. 27 with 4 hours of general debate. Previous question shall be considered as ordered without intervening motions. Measure will be considered read. Specified amendments are in order. The resolution waives all points of order against consideration of the concurrent resolution. The resolution waives all points of order against the amendments printed in the report. The resolution provides that if more than one such amendment is adopted, then only the one receiving the greater number of affirmative votes shall be considered as finally adopted. In the case of a tie for the greater number of affirmative votes, then only the last amendment to receive that number of affirmative votes shall be considered as finally adopted. The resolution permits the chair of the Budget Committee to offer amendments in the House pursuant to section 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to achieve mathematical consistency. The resolution provides that the concurrent resolution shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question of its adoption.</text>
