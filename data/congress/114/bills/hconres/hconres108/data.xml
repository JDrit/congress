Affirms that:

 religious freedom includes the right to live, work, associate, and worship in accordance with one's beliefs for people of any faith or of no faith; all Americans can be unified in supporting religious freedom because it is a fundamental human right; and the American people will remain forever unshackled in matters of faith.</summary>
