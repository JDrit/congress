Military Land and National Defense Act or the Military LAND Act - Amends the National Historic Preservation Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to notify the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources if a property owned by the federal government is being considered for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, for designation as a National Historic Landmark, or for nomination to the World Heritage List. Prohibits&#160;such inclusion or designation of federal property if the head of any federal agency managing such property objects to such inclusion or designation for national security reasons, such as any impact the inclusion or designation of such property&#160;would have on use of the property for military training or readiness.

Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations to allow for expedited removal of&#160;a federal property listed on the National Register of Historic Places if the managing agency of such property submits a written request to remove the property for national security reasons.</summary>
