Captive Primate Safety Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to: (1) make nonhuman primates a prohibited wildlife species; and (2) make it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase them in interstate or foreign commerce.

(Sec. 3) Modifies exceptions to restrictions on such transactions in prohibited wildlife species, making them inapplicable to a person who: (1) is a licensed and inspected person only if the person does not allow direct contact between the public and prohibited wildlife species, or (2) is transporting under certain conditions a single primate of the genus Cebus that was obtained from and trained by a charitable organization to assist a permanently disabled individual with a severe mobility impairment. Removes state-licensed wildlife rehabilitators from the list of entities exempted from the restrictions.

Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act.</summary>
